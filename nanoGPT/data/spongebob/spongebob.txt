Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants

[captain laughs]

[plays flute tune]

[music]

Ah, the sea,
so fascinating, so wonderful.

Here we see Bikini Bottom,
teeming with life,

home of one of my
favorite creatures

SpongeBob SquarePants.

Yes, of course he lives
in a pineapple, you silly.

[snoring]

[horn blows]

Today's the big day, Gary.

[meows]

Look at me! I'm...naked!

Got to be
in top physical condition

for today, Gary.

[meows]

I'm ready!

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm Ready, I'm ready

Go, SpongeBob!

Whoa!

[crashes]

There it is the finest eating
establishment

ever established for eating,

The Krusty Krab,
home of the crabby patty

with a help wanted sign
in the window.

For years, I've been dreaming
of this moment.

I'm going to go in there,
march straight to the manager,

look him straight in the eye,

lay it on the line
and I can't do this!

Patrick!

Where do you think
you're going?

I was just...
No, you're not.

You're going to The Krusty Krab
and get that job!

I can't, don't you see?

I'm not good enough.

Whose first words were,
"May I take your order?"

Mine were.

Who made a spatula
out of toothpicks in wood shop?

I did.

Who'sWho's

Who's a bigyellow cube
with holes?

I am!
Who's ready?

I'm ready!

Who's ready?
I'm ready!

Who's ready?
I'm ready!

I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready.

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!

Oh, no, SpongeBob!

What could he possibly want?

Go, SpongeBob!

Go, SpongeBob!

Go, SpongeBob, go, self.

Mr. Krabs!

Hurry, Mr. Krabs,
before it's too late.

I got to tell you about

Permission to come aboard,
captain.

I've been training my whole life
for the day

I can join the Krusty crew,
and now I'm ready.

[bouncing and yelping]

So, uh, when do I start?

Well, lad, it looks like you
don't even have your sea legs.

Mr. Krabs,

please, I'll prove
I'm fry cook material.

Ask Squidward,
he'll vouch for me.

No.

Well, lad,
we'll give you a test,

and if you pass
you'll be on the Krusty crew.

Go out and fetch me aa

Hydrodynamic spatula

with port
and starboard attachments

and turbo drive.

And don't come back
till you get one.

Aye, aye, captain.

One hydrodynamic spatula

with port
and starboard attachments,

turbo drive,
coming right up, sir!

Carry on!

We'll never see
that lubber again.

You're terrible.

A hydro what?

[laughing]

Hey, hey, please!

Passengers are to stay seated

and not put their heads
out the windows.

[laughter inside continues]

That sounded like hatch doors.

Do you smell it?

That smell,
a kind of smelly smell.

A smelly smell
that smells smelly.

Anchovies!

What?

Anchovies!

[anchovies clamoring]

Please, please! Quiet!

Is this any way to behave?

Can we show a little decency
and form a neat,

singlefile line
in front of the register?

[clamoring hysterically]

Barg'NMart,
meeting all your spatula needs

All hands on deck!

Get your anchors
out of your pants!

One singlefile line
is all I ask!

Whoa!

Batten down the hatches,
Mr. Squidward!

We're taking on water,
Mr. Squidward!

I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward!

Spatula, spatula

Port
and starboard attachments

Help!

Man overboard!

Climb, Mr. Squidward, climb!

This is the end!

Goodbye, Mr. Squidward.

Oh, Mr. Krabs!

[sobbing]

Permission to come aboard,
captain.

Dadadadadadah!

Did someone order a spatula?

[babbling incoherently]

That's right,
one hydrodynamic spatula

with port
and starboard attachments

and let's not forget
the turbo drive.

Would you believe
they only had one in stock?

To the kitchen!

Who's hungry?

[anchovies clamor]

Things that bother
you never bother me

I'm as happy as pie, haha!

Living in the sunlight,
loving in the moonlight

Having a wonderful time

Haven't got a lot,
I don't need a lot

Coffee's only a dime

Living in the sunlight,
loving in the moonlight

Having a wonderful time

Just take it from me, I'm just
as free as any brother

I do what I like just
when I like, and how I love it

I'm right here to stay,
when I'm old and gray

I'll be right in my prime

Living in the sunlight,
loving in the moonlight

Having a wonderful time

[trilling the tune]
[blows a musical note]

That was the finest
fastfoodsmanship

I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants.

Welcome aboard.

But Mr. Krabs

Three cheers for SpongeBob!

Hip, hip

Hooray. Mr. Krabs

Hip, hip
Hooray.

Hip, hip
Hooray.

Mr. Krabs

I'll be in my quarters
counting up the booty.

Good morning, Krusty crew!

What would you like to order,
Patrick?

One crabby patty, please.

Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs,
come see your new employee.

Living in the sunlight,
loving in the moonlight

Having a wonderful time

[motor throbbing]

[gasps]

[buzzing like a bee]

Wow, four stingers.

[buzzing]

Oh!

[girl yelling]

[grunting]

Where have I seen this before?

Here it is, Land Squirrel.

That little squirrel
is in trouble.

Take that, you sorry old clam.

You need to learn some manners!

You're about
as ugly as homemade soup.

Hooray, Land Squirrel!

[growls]

Look out!

[grunting]

Hold on, little squirrel!

Hohohoho!

Hoyya!

You have fought well,
giant clam.

Prepare to be vanquished.

Hey, I'm actually doing it.

Your shell is mine!

Hold on there,
little square dude.

[clam whimpers]

Hey, you like karate, too.

Ha!

So, what's your name?

Sandy.

So, what do you call yourself?

I'm SpongeBob!

Well, SpongeBob,
take a gander at this.

[cracking]

Oh.

Oh, yeah?

Watch this.

[armpitfarts]

[giggles]

I like you, SpongeBob.

Well, we could be
tighter than bark on a tree.

I like you too, Sandy.

What is that on your head?

Oh, that's my air helmet.

May I try it on?

Heck no, I need it to breathe.

I got to have my air.

Me, too! I love air.

Air is good.

No kidding?
Why?

Air is my middle name.

The more air, the better.

Can't get enough air.

How about coming over tomorrow
for tea and cookies then?

Don't be late.

Okay, see you tomorrow.

Patrick!
Patrick!

Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!

What's air?

Huh?

I just met this girl.

She wears a hat full of air.

Do you mean
she "puts on airs"?

I guess so.

That's just fancy talk.

If you want to be fancy
hold your pinky up like this.

The higher you hold it,
the fancier you are.

How's that?

Higher.
Like that?

Now, that's fancy!

They should call you
SpongeBob FancyPants!

Remember,
when in doubt, pinky out.

You can do it, SpongeBob.

I'll be watching.

Thanks, pal.

[rings bell]

Hey, hello?

Hiya, Sandy.
It's me, SpongeBob.

Hold on a sec,
I'll let you in.

[buzzing]

[whistling]

Sandy! Sandy!

Open up!

Sandy! Sandy!

Sandy,
something's gone terribly wrong.

There's no water in

here.

Course there's no water.

Nothing but air.

No water?

That ain't a problem, is it?

Problem?

That's how I like my air.

[inhales deeply]

[coughing]

With no water.

Well, all right.

I made Texas tea and cookies.

Well, come on in.

[legs squeaking]

That's not in.

In!

[squeaking]

You're a funny little dude.

Come on,
I'll give you the grand tour.

So this is my
own private little air bubble.

This air is the driest

[gasps]

Purest

[gasps]

Most airiest
air in the whole sea.

Oh, over there is my birdbath.

And that's my oak tree.

It provides me with extra air.

This dome is made
of the strongest polyurethane.

That's a fancy name for plastic.

Ain't that just the bee's knees?

Tell you what, weren't easy
getting here neither.

First, I had to hitch it up
to a big, old

[grunting]

[chirping angrily]

That's my treadmill.

That's how I stay in
tiptop shape.

Oh, come on.

Let's have that tea now.

[knocking on dome]

Pinky, pinky!

I brought you some flowers.

For me?

How sweet!

You okay?

Yes.

I'm okay.

You know,

you're the first sea critter
to ever visit.

I can't imagine why.

Can I get you anything?

Water would be nice.

I'm going to put these
in a vase.

Take your time.

[gasping]

I got to get out of here!

I like you, SpongeBob.

We could be
tighter than bark on a tree.

[Sandy echo]

When in doubt, pinky out.

[Patrick echo]
I don't need water.

Water is for quitters.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

Why, these flowers
are just beautiful.

They'll live much, much longer

in a vase
full of icecold water.

So tell me about yourself.

It must be fascinating
being a sea critter.

SpongeBob?

[timer dings]

Oh, there's the cookies.

Be right back.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I definitely don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I don't need it.

I need it!

[wheezing]

No, SpongeBob!
No, no, no!

Stop!

Pinky, pinky!

I'm a quitter!

[SpongeBob wailing]

You can't leave now.

You'll blow it.

Air is not good, Patrick.

Air is not good.

You're just being shy.

Don't worry, buddy.

You're doing fine.

[panting heavily]

I won't let you blow.

This

What kind of place is this?

There's no water in here!

I tried to tell you.

We got to get out of here!

You're doing it wrong.

Wait, no,
we've got to get out.

[door opens, closes]

Come and get it.

You're all going to like this

[shrieks]
[glasses breaking]

There, that ought to do it.

If you all needed water,
you should have asked.

I propose a toast,
to new friends!

Hold on a second.

I hope
you all like your tea strong.

Drink up!

[both slurping]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants

Absorbent and yellow

[captain laughs]
[plays flute tune]

[music]

[breathes deeply and sighs]

What a wonderful day.

The sun is out,
the water is shimmering,

scallops are chirping.

So peaceful!

Can we lower the volume,
please!

I can't work
with all that racket going on.

Oh, sure thing, Squidward.

Right.

Okay.

[bubbles gurgle]

And now
for some soothing sounds

from Squidward's clarinet.

Thank you, thank you.

[inhales]

[playing basic notes offkey]

[banging noisily]

I thought Ihuh?

Hey, Squidward,
want to blow some bubbles?

Only 25 cents.

Oh, right,

like I would spend a moment
of my time blowing bubbles.

Uhhuh.
Oh, please!

I mean, who in the world
would pay to blow bubbles?

Good morning.

Oh, boy.

Good morning to you, sir.

Would you care to blow a bubble?

Oh, how much is it?

Only a quarter.

Sounds reasonable.

I'm going
to need to borrow a quarter.

Sure thing, Patrick.

Ah!

One quarter.

Thank you.

Business is booming.

[laughs]

How did I ever get surrounded
by such loser neighbors?

[plays squeaky jazz melody]

One bubble wand,
dipped and ready to go.

Ooh!

[inhales]

[lips sputtering]

[glass shatters]
[sputtering continues]

[Patrick pants and sputters]

Could I interest you
in some lessons?

Only 25 cents.

Very well, then.

Hey, sponge,
can I borrow another quarter?

Thanks.

Okay, Patrick,
it's all in the technique.

First go like this,
spin around, stop!

Doubletake three times,
one, two, three,

then pelvic thrust.

Whoo! Whoo!

Stop on your right foot.

Don't forget it!

Now it's time
to bring it around town.

Bring it around town.

Then you do this,
then this and this,

then that and this
and that and this and then

[puffs gently]

Ooh!

Ah!

Ah!

[guffaws]

Huh?

And now with two hands!

[Patrick guffaws]

It's a giraffe.

[Patrick guffaws
uncontrollably]

[elephant trumpets]

excuse me, sir,
but we are close.

Don't give me any of that.

How could you two possibly make

all this noise
just blowing bubbles?

We're not just blowing bubbles,
we're making bubble art.

Watch carefully.

First go like this,
spin around, stop!

Doubletake three times,
one, two, three,

then pelvic thrust.

Whoo! Whoo!

Stop on your right foot.

Don't forget it!

Now it's time
to bring it around town.

Bring it around town.

Then you do this,
then this and this,

then that and this
and that and this and then

[puffs gently]

That's not art.

That's just annoying,
blowing bubbles.

That's the lamest idea
I have ever heard.

You should be
ashamed of yourself.

[chuckles] Bubbles

art.

Bubbles.

Ridiculous.

[sniffs]

[takes deep breath]

That'll be 25 cents, sir.

Whoa, what?

Oh!

Who would pay 25 cents
to blow bubbles?

!

We also offer lessons
for beginners.

Beginners?

What could be more simple
than blowing a stupid bubble?

Here's your 25 cents.

Watch and learn.

Wait, wait, wait.

One more time.
Here, wait, wait.

[inhales deeply]

[sputters]

Whoa!

[both whistle]

Just a mere warmup.

[sputters]

Hey, Squidward,
remember the technique.

Squidward, technique!

You do this and this,
step back.

Technique, Squidward.

Spin around like this.

Over here,
one, two, yeah, three

The pelvic whoo!

Don't forget the whoo!

Squidward

Listen to sponge.

Technique!

Technique!

Technique!
Technique!

Technique!
No, technique!

Technique!
Technique!

Tech
You're not doing the technique.

Technique!

Technique!

Technique, technique,
technique, technique, technique!

First I do this,
spin around, stop.

Doubletake three times,
and here we go,

pelvic thrust.

Whoo! Whoo!

Oh, stop on your right foot.

Don't forget it!

Then bring it around town
and a little of this,

a little of that,
a little of this, this,

that, that, that,
that, that, then

[screaming maniacally]

Wow!
Wow!

All right, Squid!

That was so good!

Squid is number one.

I really did it, didn't I?

Yeah, you guys
didn't blow anything like that.

Nope.

Now, that's a bubble.

You said it, Squidward.

See, it is all in the technique.

Yeah, technique.

Technique?

SpongeBob,
you don't think I created That

[kisses noisily]

beautiful work of art
with your help.

Come on, it's in my genes.

Squid's got genes!

Squid's got genes!
Squid's got genes!

Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

[clarinet playing snazzy tune]

Squidward, Squidward,
Squidward, Squidward,

[plays final notes to melody]

hello, my friends,
you are looking at a

Squidward! [SpongeBob echo]

Squidward! [Patrick echo]

Genius.

[bubble pops, air sputters,
ocean rumbles]

Wow!
Wow!

[clarinet plays squeaky notes]

Ah, Goo Lagoon,

a stinky mud puddle
to you and me

but to the inhabitants
of Bikini Bottom a wonderful,

stinky mud puddle.

What a great day!

Hey, Sandy, look!

I'm Sandy!

Hey, Sandy, who am I?

[laughing]

[phone rings]

Hello, SpongeBob,
could you keep it down?

I'm trying to be boring.

SpongeBob.

[doorbell rings]

Did anyone order
20 pepperoni and sand pizzas?

[both laughing]

Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.

Hey, Larry.

You guys want to go
lift some weights?

Sure.

Oh, come on, SpongeBob.

Coming.

[grunting and groaning]

Give it a try, Sandy.

[applause]

Good job, Sandy.

That's about enough for today.

How about a little more weight?

Observe.

Yah!

[cheering and whooping]

All right,
stand back, everyone.

Y'all watch this.

Yah!

[creaking]
[crash]

Way to go, Larry!

[crowd cheering]

Could I borrow
a couple of these?

And now,
with the addition of two,

count them, two, Marshmallows.

[cloth ripping]

[all gasp]

[all laughing]

That was too funny.

You are hilarious!

Ain't he the funniest
little sponge you ever saw?

Anybody up for some volleyball?

[crowd cheering]

I got it!

[crowd groans, cowbell clangs]

Incoming!

[crowd booing]
[pants rip]

Oops!

I guess I ripped my pants again.

[crowd laughing]

Once again, dude,
you have split my sides.

Hey, Sandy!

How about throwing it to me?

Okay, here it comes.

I could use a hand here.

You okay, SpongeBob?

I guess so,
except I ripped my pants!

[all laughing]

You still got it, dude.

[footsteps squeaking]

May I help you?

I'll take a banana split.

We don't have that.

That's okay.

I already split my pants,
get it?

Teehee.

Anything else?

how about, ripple?

!

No, thanks, already got one.

[laughing]
[footsteps sproinging]

Is that a burger you're eating?

Why, yes, it is.

You know
what would go good with that?

No, what?

Ripped pants.

Ripped pants a la mode.

Delivery!

Did you order
20 cases of ripped pants?

Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon.

And here comes Larry,
doing his trademark layback.

There goes Sandy,
hanging ten, fingers, that is.

There goes SpongeBob...

[cloth ripping]

Ripping his pants again.

Hey, look!

A cardboard box
washed up on the beach.

Holy fish paste!

It's a guy!

Why?

!

[sobbing] Why?

!

[shrieking] Why?

!

SpongeBob!

Come closer.

I needI need

What do you need?

A tailor.

Because I ripped my pants.

[all grumbling]

That kind of stuff
is uncalled for.

What is that?

That wasn't funny, SpongeBob.

Y'all had me worried sick.

Dude.

[rip]

Come on, SpongeBob,
you're losing them!

Think!
Your public's waiting.

Let's see.

Lifting weights, big laugh.

Frisbee in face, kills.

Surfing, knocks them dead.

Pretending to drown, no.

Come on, think!

I got it!

Hey, everybody.

Not ripped pants,
pants ripped off.

Huh?

Someone call the police.

There's a pants thief
on the loose.

[wind howling]

[voices in distance]

[party music playing]

Oh, no!

Everybody's gone, even Sandy.

She'd rather
hang out with Larry.

Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

We blew it, pants.

What do you mean, we?

Oh, I didn't have to be a fool
to get Sandy's attention.

Am I the biggest
loser on the beach?

No, I am.

I forgot to put on sunscreen.

[electronic buzzing]

Ouch.

No, I am.

I got sand in my buns.

[thunderous rumbling]

No, I'm the biggest
loser on the beach.

They buried me in the sand
and forgot me.

[all together]
What happened to you?

I lost my best friend.

How?

When I ripped

My pants

I thought that
I had everybody on my side

But I went and blew it
all skyhigh

And now she won't even spare
a passing glance

All just because I

[rip]

Ripped my pants

When big Larry came round

Just to put him down

SpongeBob turned
into a clown

And no girl ever wants
to dance

With a fool who went and

[rip]

Ripped his pants

I know
I shouldn't mope around

I shouldn't curse

But the pain feels
so much worse

'Cause winding up
with no one is a lot less fun

Than a burn from the sun

Or sand in your buns

[scratching]
[thump]

Now I learned a lesson
I won't soon forget

So listen
and you won't regret

Be true to yourself

Don't miss your chance

And you won't end up

Like the fool

Who ripped his pants

[loud rip]

[audience cheering]

SpongeBob!

Sandy!

Your song is true.

If y'all want to be my friend
just be yourself.

SpongeBob,
that was so righteous.

Would you sign my pants?

Absolutely, buddy.

[rips]
[somebody whistles]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[buzzing]

Ah.

It is the early morning
in bikini bottom

when the jellyfish are buzzing

about making
their jellyfish jelly.

Oh, what is happening here?

Collectors?

[chirps happily]

[loud, thrash music plays]

[music stops abruptly]

[howling in pain]

[music resumes]

[buzzing approaches]

[singing nonchalantly]

I think I got it.

No, wait a minute.

[electricity crackling,
Patrick yelps]

Go, go, go, go!
[buzzing angrily]

Ooh!
Ouch!

Oohooh!

[buzzing continues]

Ooh!
Ouch!

Hmm.

Hey, Squidward.

We're jellyfishing.

[groans]

Of course you are.
Bye, now.

Wait!

We made a net
especially for you.

Do you want to come with us?

Really?
Jellyfishing with you guys?

Oh, that would be the best day
ever in my book.

I would love
to go jellyfishing.

I can't think of anything

I'd love to do more
on my day off

than go jellyfishing
with my two best friends

SpongeBob and... uh...

Patrick.

Right.

But I can't, byebye.

Next time?

Oh, sure. Right.

Whatever.

Like that'll ever happen.

You know, Patrick,
it always seems like Squidward

never has time for fun.

Maybe he doesn't like us.

No, are you kidding?
We're his best friends.

[laughing nastily]

Jellyfishing!

[laughs and snorts]
[sarcastically]

Oh, I'll go.

[laughs]

I sure had them going.

[cackles]

[jellyfish buzzing]

[gags]

Stupid jellyfish, beat it!

Whoa! Whoa...

Wha... wha...

Ow! Ooh! Whoa!

Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

[screams]

[explosion]

Ow.

[wheelchair motor whirring]

Squid's back.

[phone ringing]
Hello.

Hey, Patrick, squid's home
and we're going to make sure

he's greeted by
his two best friends.

Oh, great, who are they?

Us.

Let's go.

[wheelchair motor whirring]

[noisemakers blare]

Welcome home, Squidward!

Merry Christmas!

We're going to make
this your best day ever!

[motor revs]

Well, your best day's
sure not going to be out there.

How about some soup
on your best day ever?

Here we go.

[mumbles in protest]

Oh, it's a little hot.

[Squidward groans in pain]

Huh!

[blows strongly]
[moans]

[blows strongly]
[whimpers]

[inhaling deeply]

III don't think soup
is the best thing for him

on his best day ever.

How about some music
on your best day ever?

Played on your
very own clarinet?

[takes a deep breath]

[reedy, squeaky blare]

Sorry, my lips
are a little dry.

[smacks lips together]

[clears throat,
licks lips wetly]

[licking lips
wetly and noisily]

[blows raspberry]

Mmhmm, mmhmm.

[takes a deep breath]

Music isn't best, either.

But what is best
is what we saved for last

The one surefire thing
to make your best day ever

the best day ever.

Jellyfishing, jellyfishing,
jellyfishing, jellyfishing,

jellyfishing, jellyfishing,
jellyfishing, jellyfishing!

This is jellyfish fields

where wild jellyfish roam
just waiting to be captured.

[wheelchair motor whirring]

No, no, squid, over here.

I know you're eager

but you don't even
have your net.

Patrick, fix him up while
I find him a good specimen.

Firmly grasp it in your hand.

Firmly grasp it.

Firmly grasp it!

[loud crunch]
[muffled howling]

That ought to do it.

[jellyfish buzzing]

There's one in position.

Ready...

Set...

Go!

Go, Squid! You got it!
You got it.

Go, squid! Go, Squidder!
Go, Squidder!

Go, go, go!
Yes, you got it!

Get it, Squidder!

I think we better show him
how it's done.

[to the tune of "On the
Beautiful Blue Danube]

Dadadadadum

Dadadadadum...

[in deeper voice]
Dadadadadum...

Dadadadadum...

[buzzes melody]

Dadadadadum...

Dadada

Dadadadada
dadumdadumdum.

[SpongeBob and Patrick yelling
in pain, jellyfish buzzing]

[jellyfish buzzing]

[electricity crackling]

[snarls]

Ooh! Ooh!
Ow! Ow!

Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

Hey, look, Squid's doing it.

Go, Squid, get 'em, Squid!
Squidster, you're doing it!

Go Squid! Go Squid!

[wheelchair motor whirring]

[wheelchair stops abruptly]

[whirring resumes]

[muffled]
Aha!

[muffled cackling]

[whimpers]

This guy's good.

He's a natural.

Yeah. You got it!
You're doing great!

Go, Squid, go!

Keep doing it, Squid.

See what you've been missing?

Yeah, you got it, Squid.

Go, Squid, go!
Go, Squid, go! Go, Squid, go!

Use that net.

Be the net.

Yeah,
you're feeling it, Squid.

That's it.

All the way,
take him all the way.

[11:17] six miles
makes the Squid.

Go, go, go.

You got 'em now.

It's in the bag!

This is really your
best day ever, isn't it?

[loud zap]

Ooh.
Ooh..

[both groaning and wincing]

Hey, Patrick.

Well...

I thought yesterday went
pretty well, don't you think?

I had fun.

Me, too.

Here comes Squidward.

Oh, great.

[hospital bed whirring]

Hey, Squid, how about that...

best day ever.

There's always tomorrow.

We're really sorry about what
happened yesterday, Squidward.

We got you a present.

[buzzing]

It's the jellyfish.

You know, from yesterday.

You're not still mad, are you?

Yep, he's still mad.

[jellyfish buzzing angrily]

[hollering]

[cackling]

[giant jellyfish buzzing]

[stops laughing]

[zap]

[glass shatters]

Ow.

[music]

One crabby patty
for table two.

SpongeBob, I don't
have the whole day!

Oui, oui, une crabby
patty, monsieur.

There's les patty.

Come on, SpongeBob!

Next, l'ingredients.

Ahwhee!

Les mustard.

Will you quit fooling around?

Where's my crabby patty?

Les hold on a second.

And voila.

It's under your nose!

[cackles]

[laughs]

You're killing me, SpongeBob.

Ha, ha!

You really are.

Look at it, Squidward

Mr. Krabs' gift to
all of bikini bottom

The crabby patty.

Okay, give it to me.

Come on, SpongeBob, stop it!

I swear,
I'm not doing anything.

Mr. Krabs!

That crabby patty is haunted!

Avast, ye patty pirate!

This is no ghost.

This is... Plankton!

Stealin' me booty!

Hear me, Krabs

When I discover your formula
for crabby patties

I'll run you out of business.

I went to college!

Hey!

Let me go!

Oh, I'll let you go, Squirt...

on a flying saucer!

[laughs maliciously]

Back to the chum
bucket with you!

You'll pay for this, Krabs!

Uh... Plankton, sir?

Aye, he's been
trying to steal me

secret formula for years.

But ye haven't got it yet,
have ye, bug?

[both laugh]

[stops laughing]

Okay.

Enough, lad,
it wasn't that funny.

Get back to work!

Okay, Mr. Krabs,
see you tomorrow.

Good night, me boy.

Psst...

Young man...

Yes, over here.

Come on, boy, a little closer.

Closer.

Not that close!

Ah!

You blasted barnacle head!

I mean...

Hi!

Plankton?

Ouch!

What do you want?
I just want to talk.

You could say
we're friends, right?

Um... No.

Acquaintances.

No.

Well, we're both
invertebrates, aren't we?

I... guess so.

You see, everything works out.

I have something for you.

I've been keeping it in
my secret compartment.

Ching!

Sparkle, sparkle!

Wow!

A golden spatula!

And it's even got
my name on it.

It's a gift.

A gift from a friend.

Friends give each other gifts.

And tomorrow is my birthday.

[toots]

And you know what
I'd like more than anything

in the whole wide world?

A booster seat?

Booster seat?
Hot dog!

I mean, no.

What I want for my birthday
from you,

my friend is one of those...

tender...

delicious...

crabby patties.

[cries out]

You just want to be friends

so you can get your hands
on a crabby patty!

And I bet it's not even
your birthday tomorrow!

Gee, and I thought
you were stupid.

You'll never get
a crabby patty from me!

Even if we are friends!

Never, never, never, never!

Oh, I'll get a crabby patty.

And you're going
to handdeliver it to me

personally!

You weakminded fool!

[dramatic film music plays]

Night, Gary.

[meows]

[snoring]

[chuckles]

SpongeBob, you will be mine.

Letters of the
alphabet, a, b, c...

[dramatic film music plays]

It should be in here
somewhere.

But where?

Where?

Oh.

This will be the beginning
of the end.

[snoring]

Ouch!

Stupid brain.

Come back here, you swine!

Whoa... oof!

That's it, brain,
you're going down!

Yes, yes, that's grand.

And now, for my very elaborate
and collegeeducated plan.

And now it's time
for a little wakeyuppy.

Morning already?

I...
I feel a little funny today.

Yeah, yeah!

I have you now.

Time for a wellbalanced
breakfast.

This isn't what I had in mind.

Let me just grab my pants.

I guess I'm not wearing
any pants today.

Oops!

I guess I'm not using
the door, either.

See you later, Gary...

I guess.
[Gary meows]

You're right, Gary,

there is something wrong
with me!

Squidward!

Squidward!

Wake up!

I need some help!

Squidward!

Help!

Be quiet, SpongeBob!

Help!

SpongeBob, what are you doing?

I'm talking to you!

SpongeBob, SpongeBob!

Are you mad?

[in plankton's voice]

Shut your mouth,
you mediocre clarinet player.

Mediocre?

You pretentious
little insignificant artist.

Your sniveling creations
are worth less

than a protozoan's waist.

[in his own voice] Something
must be wrong with my brain!

[gasps]
Plankton!

What kind of friend are you?

Nonsense!

You never liked me, anyway.

You wouldn't even come
to my birthday party!

Get out of my head!

Leave my brain alone!

[with plankton voice]
Never!

Never!

[laughs evilly]

[sighs]

[snoring]

Toot, toot!

How about a little takeout?

Nope, no, never!

[plankton laughing evilly]

You can't fool me, Plankton.

You want the crabby
patty formula!

You are going to
handdeliver it to me

personally.

No, no, no!

There's no one here.

Don't remind me.

Brace yourself, SpongeBob.

This is my lab!

[barks]

And this is my laboratory!

And did I ever show you
my record player?

[dramatic film music plays]

I must fight.

[mumbling nonsensically]

No, no, no, no!

[screams]

Ow, ow, ow, ow!

There, you see
how much easier it is

when you help, friend?

How do you like my analyzer?

It tells the ingredients
of whatever I put into it.

Seaweed: 50% sea, 50% weed.

Impressed?

Now let's reveal
that secret formula.

And this little piggy brought
home a crabby patty.

This little piggy
will help me drop it in.

Any last words,
SpongeBob secret pants?

I... I...

I just have to say
I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.

I let all of bikini
bottom down.

But worst of all,

I let you down you delicate
little crabby patty.

Mmm!

With your tasty, juicy,
scrumptious warm,

steamy goodness.

Steamy!

I'll never forget your 100%
allsecret patty

secretly assembled
with undersea cheese

pickle, lettuce, tomato, onion

all secretly steaming between
two fluffy seaweedseed buns.

Yes...

Yes...

Yes!

Come to papa!

Oh, boy.
[electricity crackles]

[analyzer beeping]

Plankton: one percent evil,
99% hot gas.

Well, this stinks.

Well, Patty, I guess
we can go home now.

SpongeBob,
that's my crabby patty!

Give it back, you porous freak!

I command you!

My patty!

No!

I'll settle for some fries.
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh

Who lives in a pineapple
Under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants

Absorbent and yellow
And porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants

If nautical nonsense
Be something you wish

Then drop on the deck
And flop like a fish

[captain laughs]

[plays flute tune]

[music]

Wow!

Squidward,
this is the best soufflé

you have ever created.

Oh! Congratulations, chef.

[water running]

[brushing]

[gargling, then spits]

[someone giggles]

[two voices giggling]

[whispering]

Hi, Patrick.

Hi, SpongeBob.

[SpongeBob laughing]

Patrick, you're my best friend
in the whole neighborhood.

[mumbling gibberish]

Patrick,
you are the dumbest idiot

it has ever been
my misfortune to know.

[muttering gibberish]

Do you really think that,
SpongeBob?

Of course, Patrick.

Anyone with eyes
could see that.

[bubble pops]

Yeah, well,
I think you're ugly!

Yellow is ugly!

[blows a raspberry]

Patrick,
what are you talking about?

SpongeBob,

I no longer wish to know you.

You give bottom dwellers
a bad name.

[Squidward mumbling]

If I had a dollar
for every brain you don't have,

I'd have one dollar.

Hey, Patrick,
I heard there was a job opening

down at the pet shop
as some newspaper!

That makes you
a big dummy, you dummy!

Yeah, well,
that means that, so are you!

Right, you're a turkey!

What's that?

It's what you are!

Well, you're a bigger one.

Well, you're still yellow.

You know what else is yellow?

What?

You are!
Yeah.

Well, it doesn't matter
what you call me

'cause I never want to see you
again anyway!

[chomping loudly]

[door squeaks open]

Aw, tartar sauce!

Whoa, Squidward,
you're choking!

Oh, I know what to do

but I should wash
my hands first.

Oh, well.

[inhaling deeply]

[exhaling]

[spits]

I win!

Wow!

Patrick!

You saved me.

I did?
Yep.

You're a real lifesaver,
friend.

Friend?

Friend!

Yeah, Patrick,
we're friends, just friends.

So, what are we going to do
tonight, best friend?

Well, I was going to practice
my clarinet solo.

Clarinet?

I love music!

Aw, who needs them?

They're no fun anyway,
right, Gary?

Gary?

Squidward will be performing

his version
of "Solitude in E Minor."

Yeah!

"E minor", all right, yeah!

[begins playing]

[snoring]

Aw, what am I worried about?

I got plenty of friends.

I can name three
right off the bat.

The gang's all here.

Oh!

[grunting and grumbling]

Oh, oh, my back!

I threw out my back.

Oh, boy!

Now's my chance.

SpongeBob?

No, no, stay back!

Don't worry, Squidward,
I'm coming!

No, no, no, get away from me!

Hang on, I'll save you!

No, no, no, no,
get away from me!

No, no.
Hold on!

No! No!

Get away!

[crack]

Ow, I'm ruined!

IIII feel great.

Thanks, SpongeBob.

You're a real friend.

Friend!

No, no, no!
I didn't mean that. No, no

Don't worry, Squiddy old pal.

That's what friends are for.

So dumb Patrick
fell asleep on you, huh?

Some friend!

A real friend
would perform for you.

You play?

Are you kidding?

I've been playing bassinet
for years.

Give me an A buddy.

[plays a note]

Squidward is my best friend
In the world...

[strings grating raucously]

♪Squidward is my best friend
In the sea...

[Squidward yells]

[grumbles]

More than SpongeBob

Rotten friend, Squidward!

Um, I can fix this.

[growling and grumbling]

[shout, thud]

So, uh, I'll see you tomorrow,
Squidward.

Call me.

ugh!

That was disgusting!

Feel like I need
to scrub myself.

[screaming]

Hey, buddy,
I warmed it up for you.

Patrick, get out!

And put some clothes on.

What's the matter,
Squidward, old buddy?

Oh, ho!

So this is what I find, huh?

My best friend
and my exbest friend

and rubber bath toys!

[both arguing at once]

[yells]

This can't be happening to me!

[door opens and closes]

Buddy, yet go friend.
Squidward, where are you?

Oh, this is nuts!

I need a plan
to get those two back together

and out of my hair.

[doorbell rings]

[sniffs]

Squidward!

A dinner party?

I'd love to!

[knocking at door]

Did you miss me?

Come on in.

You look stunning.

I'd much rather dine with you.

Than that lousyOh!

Say, what gives?

I'm not sitting
near that maniac!

Me, neither!

This was a setup.

I thought you two
were my best friends.

[both] I am your best friend.

Well, how about
some soda, guys?

Yes, please.

Thanks, friend.

How about some
for your best friend?

Thanks, best friend.

Can I have some now, buddy?

Wait! I need some more.

I still didn't get any.

There you go. More, please.

[laughs]

[both laughing uproariously]

[creaking]

[laughter continuing]

[deep groan]

[crash]

I should just walk away
right now.

What a surprise.

I invited them in
and I left them alone.

Well, Squidward,
what have we learned today?

Guess what, Squidward?

Me and SpongeBob
are friends again.

Great.
Go be friends somewhere else.

Don't you want us to help you
clean this up a little?

No!

I think he's jealous.

How pathetic.

We'll see about that,
SpongeBob.

[inflating]

[crash]

Oh, SpongeBob, why?

I don't know why, Gary.

I don't know.

I'm tired of failing
that boating test.

I've already taken it 37 times.

[meows]

Okay, 38.

[meowing]

No, Gary, I'm not walking.

SpongeBob,
this is star ranger, over.

What is it, Patrick?

I got a surprise for you.

Oh, Patrick,
I'm not in the mood.

Get out of bed.

Okay, now what, Patrick?

Go to your closet
for a surprise.

Okay, I'm at the closet.

Listen carefully.

What's pink and square
at the same time?

I don't know, Patrick.

Patrick SquarePants!

Pat, don't do that.

I've got too much
to worry about.

What's the problem?

I can't pass my boating exam.

I've taken It 37

[Gary meows]

38 times.

I know all the answers,
until I get behind the wheel.

I just need something
to help me think straight.

Thinking straight
is what I do.

You drive, and I'll do
all the thinking for you.

How are we going to do that?

Come in, SpongeBob.

Hello. Hello.

Hey, I can hear you
in my head.

This is great.

While I'm taking the test

you can give me
all the answers.

Wait a minute, Patrick.

Won't I look silly

with this antenna
coming out of my head?

Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge,
testing, testing.

Testing, testing,
testing, testing,

testing, testing,
testing, testing!

[yells]

Test, test!

Do you read?

Sponge to pat, I read you

Got your apple ready?

Lucky undergarments?

Hold on, hold on.

Bingo!

Underwear, apple and me.

You're ready
to get that license.

Ohoh, here comes Mrs. Puff.

Oh, no, the first turn.

Please, tell me you know
what to do at the first turn.

Left! Right!

Oh, my,
this is Splendid, SpongeBob.

You're doing fine.

[music]

Splendid!

[laughing]

Wonderful.

There's the finish line.

It's unbelievable.

You've shown the most
spectacular improvement

of any student I've ever seen.

What's your secret?

A little radio in your head?

[both laughing]

[laughing]

Oh, and under that hat
is some kind of antenna?

[both laughing]

[laughing]

And some guy
miles away from here

is giving you
all the answers.

[both laughing]

[laughing uproariously]

Oh, yes.

But that would be cheating.

[Patrick laughs uproariously]

Aha! Cheating!

[Patrick laughing loudly]

I'm cheating?

Mrs. Puff?

Yes, my star pupil.

I think I'm cheating.

What's that, dear?

I think I am cheating!

YouYou've let go
of the wheel.

I do have an antenna
under my hat.

There is a guy
giving me all the answers.

It's all true.

I'm cheating, I'm cheating.

I'm cheating.

What?

[sobbing mournfully]

I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff.

I'm sorry.

The wheel, SpongeBob,
the wheel.

Cheating!

I'm a cheater, cheater.

No, no, no!

It's all right, you can cheat.

No, I'm cheating.

That way, SpongeBob.

I'm cheating.

Cheat that way!

Cheater,
cheater pumpkin eater.

It's okay, just

No!

That way! That way!

Cheat that way!

Cheater!

[crash]

[inflating]

Oh, SpongeBob, why?

Mrs. Puff?

I think I cheated.
My leg!

I'm sorry for letting
you down again, Mrs. Puff.

It's okay, SpongeBob.

You didn't mean it.

Okay, boys, take me away.

[grunts]

Don't worry, Mrs. Puff.

I'll try harder next semester.

[sobbing]

It'll be great!

Only now
I don't even have my bike.

[Gary meows]

Gary! My bike!

You've found it.

This sponge is still mobile.

All right, let's go surprise
someone at the hospital.
Are you ready, kids?

Aye aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow

Hurry up with those chairs,

[phone rings]

I got it. I got it! Coming!

Hello.

Sorry, sir, we're closed.
Ahoy, there!

Krusty Krab, how can I help you?

Pizza?

Of course we have pizza.

Uh, Mr. Krab

Our delivery,
Squid will bring it right over.

Mr. Krab, we don't serve pizza.

We don't deliver.

We don't deliver, but you do.

Can't you just get
SpongeBob to do it?

Great idea! Take him with you.

That's not what I had in mind.

Front end, check.

Antenna, check.

Bumper, check.

Bumper sticker, check.

Tire pressure

[buzzing]

Check.

Vehicle inspection complete.

We're really making
history here, Squidward.

That lucky customer

is going to get the first
krabby patty pizza ever!

Good, then you drive.

I can't.
I'm still in boating school.

Come on, SpongeBob,
it's just around the corner.

Well, yeah, but

Just do what you do in school.

Well, okay.

Wait, don't tell me.

Back it up.

Huh?
Back it up.

Right, back it up.

[moans]

Back it up!
Okay, okay.

Shift into reverse, SpongeBob.

Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse.

Huh?

Backing up, backing up.

[engine clanks and backfires]

Backing up.

Well, you backed up.

And you know what?

I think we're out of gas.

And you know what else?

We're in the middle of nowhere!

And you know what else, else?

I think the pizza's
getting cold.

And the pizza's cold!

Oh, the pizza's cold.

Not the pizza!

Oh, how could it get any worse?

Well, we can still deliver it

SpongeBob, what are you doing?

It's an old pioneer trick.

I saw it in a movie once.

SpongeBob,
this is no time for

Shh! It's working!

What is it?

Truck! 16 wheels!

[engine rumbling]

Now I can show you
how the pioneers hitchhiked.

Will you let go of that
stupid pizza already?

I can't! It's for the customer!

Who cares about the customer?

I do!

Well, I don't!

[gasps]
Squidward!

Let go of that pizza!

No!

SpongeBob!

Let go of the pizza!

No! It's for the customer.

SpongeBob!

Let go of the pizza!

Whoa!
SpongeBob!

[Squidward yelling]

Hang on to the pizza!

[both yelling]

[Squidward grunts]

Hey? Hey?

Whwhere's the road?

Whwhere's the road?

We're doomed!

Oh, how are we going
to get home?

Which way do we go?

What are we going to do now?
There's no road here.

I think town is this way.

Oh, don't tell me, Jethro.

The pioneers?
That's right.

Moss always points
to civilization.

That way? That way there?

So, let me get this straight.

You think that
we should go that way?

Yep.
Well, then I'm going this way.

Huh? Squid!

Wait! I don't think

Trust me,
I know where I'm going.

The Krusty Krab pizza

Is the pizza absolutivally

[mouthing percussion]
pizza♪

[mouthing drum sounds]
pizza♪

Krusty Krab pizza

Is the pizza, yeah

For you and me

[hoarsely]

Krab Pizza for You

[mumbling incoherently]

Sponge,
we've got to eat something.

I heard in times of hardship

the pioneers would eat coral.

[gobbling]

No, maybe it wasn't coral.

[spitting]

Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.

Give me the pizza!

Wait, I remember now,
it was coral!

Give it to me!
No!

We promised.
It's for the customer.

You're right,
it's for the customer.

Yeah.

Maybe we better check on it.

Make sure it's okay.

Well?
Just a peek.

Okay, it's fine.

No, I think I saw something.

Oh! No, I was wrong.

Looks okay.

Sure is a finelooking pizza.

Yeah!

What's that?
Is that the cheese?

Yeah!

And the pepperoni?

Yeah!

Oh, looks good, huh?

Wait a second!

I know what you're trying to do,
Squidward.

I'm not letting you eat
the pizza!

Give me that pizza!
No!

Don't make me take it away
from you, SpongeBob.

Get away!

Get back here, SpongeBob!

Give me that pizza!

No!

SpongeBob!

No!

SpongeBob!

No!

Wait.
No!

No!

I want that pizza.

And you're going to hand it over
one way or another.

Look, we're saved!

Sure, we're saved.
Now give me some pizza!

No, really, squid!

We're saved! We're saved!
We're saved!

Will you cut that out?

[to a conga beat]
Saved, saved

Saved, saved

Saved, saved
Saved, saved

Saved, saved, saved,
saved, saved, saved

Saved, saved,
saved, saved, saved, saved

Saved, saved, saved,
saved, saved, saved

Saved, we are saved.

That's just a stupid boulder.

It's not just a boulder,

it's a rock.

A rock! A rock!

It's a big,

beautiful old rock.

Oh, the pioneers used
to ride these babies for miles

and it's in great shape.

SpongeBob!

Will you forget
the stupid pioneers?

Have you ever noticed

that there are
none of them left?

That's because they were
lousy hitchhikers, ate coral

and took directions from algae!

And now you're telling me

they thought they could drive

Rocks.

Hold on, there, Jethro!

I can't wait to see the look
on our customer's face.

[doorbell rings]

Yeah?
Congratulations, sir.

Your krabby patty pizza's here.

Wow! Thanks!

I've been dying
for one of these.

It

Where's my drink?

What drink?

My drink!

My diet Dr. Kelp!

Don't tell me
you forgot my drink!

But you didn't order any

How am I supposed to eat
this pizza without my drink?

ButBut

Didn't you ever once think
of the customer?

You call yourself
a delivery boy?

Well, I ain't buying!

[door slams]

Sponge?

Sponge?

It's okay.

Sponge?

[wheezes loudly]

[sobbing deeply]

Sponge?

[wailing]

Another one?

Look, I told your little friend,
I ain't paying for that.

Well, this one's on the house!

Did he change his mind?

He sure did.

Ate the whole thing in one bite.

No drink?
No.

Now take me home.
Are you kidding?

We have just enough time
to make it back to work.

[tires squeal]

Work?

Oh, my aching tentacles!

[music]

Walking,
walking, walking, walking,

walking, walking, walking,

[meows]

Hurray, Gary,
we're finally huge!

[nematodes slurping]

[meows]
Huh?

Wait a minute.

Oh, no!

[nematodes slurping]

[meows]

Shell phone!

I know, I'll call Squidward.

He'll know what to do.

Hello?
Squidward!

Is it time already for you
to ruin my day?

Squidward, help me!

My house is shrinking,
I woke this morning

and I was getting smaller
and smaller

[voice speeds up,
pitch gets higher]

[dial tone hums]

Oh, no!

Yep, it is.

[SpongeBob screaming]

Is it time already
to ruin Squid's day?

Hey, SpongeBob,
don't start without me.

[still slurping]

[burps]

[all burping]

[groans]

Nematodes.

The only thing left in my house
is this little pebble.

What's going on here?

I've got bad news, guys.

Look at what happened
to my house!

It's gone!

It's all gone.

What am I going to do?

Where am I going to live?

Yeah.

Hey, SpongeBob,
your house is gone!

Well, what can I say?

It's been great knowing you,
SpongeBob.

Good luck somewhere else.

I'm going to miss you.

Boohoo!

Boohoo, boohoo!

[laughing raucously]
Boohoo!

Boohoo!
Squid's taking it real hard.

What are you going to do now?

I guess I'll have to move back
with my mom and dad.

No!

Wait a minute! No, you don't.

We can build you a new house.

We can't build a house!

Well, sure, it's easy.

I built my house all by myself.

All right, Patrick,
let's get to work.

Ow! Ow!

Ow!

[groans]

[yelling]

[yelling]

Ow!

Ow! Ow!

Ow!

We're done!

Yeah!

So, what do you think?

I wish I lived there.

Really?

No.

One bedroom.

Tartar sauce.

Well, looks like
we've got to move back

with mom and pop.

You can't move back
in with your parents.

When my parents
kicked me out of the house

I never went back.

Wait!

You and Gary
can come stay with me!

That'd be great!

Yeah, we'll be rockmates!

[crickets chirping]

Good night, SpongeBob.

Good night, rockmate.

[meows]

Good night, Gary.

No, What the

Stop! No! No!

Squidward.

[mumbling]

Squidward.
Oh, what?

Squidward, could we stay here
a couple of days

or a month or two?

Yeah, well, whatever.

Thanks.

Thanks, Squidward.

Squidward,
can you scoot over a little?

Oh, yeah, sure

Oh, while you're at it

could you get me
a glass of water?

Okay. Yeah, sure

Yeah,
this is a real swell place

you got here.

Thanks, buddy.

You're welcome.

Yeah, I like sleepovers.

Yeah, me, too.

Yep, this is great.

Good night, Squidward.

[yawning]
Good night, SpongeBob.

Good night, SpongeBob.

[rooster crows, seagulls call]

Tatadum!

Today's the big day, Squidward!

Don't want to be late!

Got to hurry!

Hold it! Hold everything!

I would not want to miss this,

the day SpongeBob moves!

I can't believe
it's really happening.

Don't worry, Squidward,
I'll come visit you.

Don't try to cheer me up,
SpongeBob

[car approaching]
please.

Here come my parents.

[bawling]

SpongeBob, hi, honey.
We're here!

Come on, SpongeBob.

Hurry, hurry, son.

Your mother has dinner waiting.

Hi, mom.

Hello, Mrs. SquarePants.

Let me help you with these bags.

Just give me a minute.

[Patrick crying in background]

I cannot hold on to you
any longer, little pebble.

You hold too many memories.

[crying]

Well, Squidward,

this is goodbye.

Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye.

Goodbye, SpongeBob,
byebyebye

Goodbye, SpongeBob

Ha, ha, goodbye, goodbye.

[crying]

Come on, SpongeBob.

Goodbye, Patrick.

Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.

[all cry out]

[crying hysterically]

SpongeBob is leaving,
he's leaving, he's leaving

la, la, la, la,
la, la, ha, ha!

Yeah, baby! Ha, ha!

SpongeBob is leaving,
he's leaving♪

[loud rumbling]

My house is back!

Oh, good old pineapple

it's exactly like
it used to be.

[all exclaiming]

Aw, Squidward, isn't this great?

I'm back forever!

[mumbling]
Forever?
Are you ready, kids?

Aye aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

Mermaid Man.

Fleet and forceful,

with the ability to assemble

and charge the creatures
of the deep,

by the power of Neptune.

Mermaid Man,
with his young associate,

Barnacle Boy
fights for all creatures

that live in the sea

against the forces of evil.

Oh, no!

The raging whirlpool.

Mermaid Man!

Champion of the deep.

Yeah! Champion of the deep.

Yippee!

Come on, Barnacle Boy,
there's evil afoot.

Leapin' lampreys, Mermaid Man.

I'm right behind you.

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
spot their arch enemy.

Reflecto, up to no good.

Sponge Bob.

You know what this means.

Doughnuts.

Ooh!

By the power of Neptune.

Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy, unite!

Creatures of the deep assemble.

[both grunting]

Think harder, Barnacle Boy.

[buzzing]
Here they come.

Blast!

Reflecto has become
too powerful.

What the...

Oh!

If Reflecto is cut off
from sunlight,

he becomes weak.

Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man.

He's destroying the shield!

[muttering]

Oh!

Quick, Barnacle Boy,
back to the sea cave.

Right, Mermaid Man.

Sponge Bob!

Sponge Bob, open up.

Reflecto has found
our secret lab.

What would
the real Mermaid Man do?

Why don't you ask him yourself.

Elaborate, you vile fiend.

He and Barnacle Boy
live in the retirement home

on the other side of town.

Hmm.

They must be working undercover.

Yeah,
now please leave me alone.

Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy, reunite!

Excuse me.

I know Mermaid Man
is working undercover

on an important case,

but do you think we could
see him?

Undercover?

Yeah, well,
I'll see if they can take time

from their busy schedule
to see you.

[laughing excitedly]

Here they are, right over there.

[happily gasping]

Try not to surprise them.

Patrick,

can you believe it?

Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy in the flesh.

Hey, who are those guys?

Are they here to fix the TV?

[nervous chattering]

What do you want?

Are you Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy?

Well, we used to be,
but now we're retired.

[gasping together]

But you can't retire.

There's evil afoot.

What evil!

Evil! Ooh!

Barnacle Boy!

Don't forget there's evil.

All I said was
there's evil afoot.

Evil!

Eee... Eee...

Would you please stop
saying that.

Evil. Evil, evil, evil, evil.

Oh!

Disgrace!

[door slams shut]

Wow!

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

It's too bad they're old.

What do you mean, Patrick.

Old people are the greatest.

They're full of wisdom
and experience.

[ting]

The world needs Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy.

Someone,
somewhere is in trouble,

and I won't rest
until Mermaid Man

and Barnacle Boy
are out of retirement.

[fireworks]

Ooh, pretty lights.

To the meatloaf.

To the broccoli.

Make sure
you give extra broccoli

to my young ward.

The boy needs his vitamins.

Here you go, son.

[snickering]

To the table

away!

Careful, don't run.

Hey, Mermaid Man.

Hey,
here comes the TV repairman.

What do you want from us?

Hold on.
Just let me look at you.

Stay alert, Barnacle Boy.

He's up to something.

Would you stop calling me boy?

Do you remember the time

the food supply in Atlantis
was running low?

So you invented a ray gun

that made things grow
six times their size to shoot

at the kelp gardens.

But then,

the evil man ray swoops down
and swipes the gun away

and shoots all the algae.

[imitating ray gun]

And he gloms
onto the undersea dome,

and he starts sucking
on the glass.

What's your point, kid?

You guys
are the greatest heroes

of all time.

And I think you should come out
of retirement.

Listen up, you villains,
I want to eat my meatloaf.

If you don't get out of here,

then by the power
invested in me

I now pronounce you man
and wife.

What is going on in here?

You may kiss the bride.

[wedding march playing]

Did you reunite our heroes?

No, but I'm married.

Up, up and away.

Up, up

and away.

Oh, my!

This purse is so big and heavy.

Hold it right there, ma'am.
I'll be taking that.

Oh!

Help! Help! Help!

It's working.

Wow, are you here
to rescue little old me?

Pipe down!

You're going to wake Mermaid Man

and he's awry
when his nap is disturbed.

Ever alert,
Mermaid Man has trained himself

to sleep with his eye open.

Confounded, get away from him.

Stop shouting! I'm napping.

It's not me, you old coot.

Yes.
That's me.

I'm over here.

[bickering]

Excuse me. Mermaid Man.

What do you want?

This better be good.

This will cheer you up.

We're almost done painting
your invisible boat mobile.

It's supposed to be invisible!

That's it!

We got to end our life
of leisure.

It's time to come out
of retirement.

There's evil afoot!

Evil!

Where is it?

There it is.

Do you know what this means?

Doughnuts.

Oh, brother.

[music starts and fades out]

[music starts and fades out]

Say the oath.

Mermaid Man
and Barnacle Boy, unite!

[music starts again
and tune finishes]

Throw a water ball at him.

Water balls!

Water balls!

Yeah!

[laughing]

Mumbling morays.
It's not working, Mermaid Man.

He's absorbing it like
some kind of evil sponge.

Dog paddle away!

It's the raging whirlpool!

[SpongeBob and Patrick cheering]

You fiends.

They're actually enjoying it!

[screaming in delight]

Do it again! Do it again!

Now what, Mermaid Man.

We need help.

Sea creatures, unite.

Huh! What!

[all mumbling and chattering]

Hmm, the creatures of the deep
seemed to have lost

some of their luster.

Sea creatures, attack!

Pinch me. I must be dreaming.

[all mumbling and chattering]

Mission accomplished, Patrick.

Yeah, we did it.

I did it.

I feel five years younger.

Oh, it's good to be back.

We did it, you old coot.

Who are you?

The new adventures

of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

We join our heroes locked
in a battle of wits.

It's the aqua phone.

What is it, chief?

Hello, hello.

Hello!

That phone is still broken.

Remind me to get that fixed.

Remind you what?

Remind me of what?

Will our heroes
ever get their phone fixed?

Tune in next week and find out.

Wow, that was even better
than the old show.

It's all thanks to you!

Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

My name is Squidward.

Can I take your order?

Hmm

Oh, I'll have a...

No.

Oh, maybe...

No.

Hmm, I'll have...

No.

Well maybe

Are you planning
on ordering today, sir?

I'll have a Krabby Patty.

How original?

And with extra onions.

Daring today, aren't we?

One Krabby Patty, extra onions.

One crying johnny coming up.

First bun, then patty,
followed by ketchup,

mustard, pickles, extra onions,

lettuce, cheese, tomatoes,
and bun in that order.

One crying johnny up!

Whatever.

Twelve Krabby Patties
on wheat buns.

[SpongeBob repeating quickly]

Bun, patty,
ketchup, tomato, bun.

Bun, patty, ketchup,
tomato, bun.

Bun, patty,
ketchup, tomato, bun.

Bun, patty, ketchup,
tomato, bun.

One dozen crying cows
on the farm.

Up!

Thanks, farmer brown.

It's been a thrill serving you.

Can I get some extra salt?

We're all out.

Could you check?
No.

Let me guess, Tiny.
A small salad?

I'll take a Double Triple
Bossy Deluxe on a raft,

fourbyfour, animalstyle,

extra shingles with a shimmy
and a squeeze,

light axle grease, make it cry,

burn it and let it swim.

We serve food here, sir.

I got it already, Squidward.

[gasping]

Bubble Bass.

SquarePants.

I hear talk
you make a mean Krabby Patty.

Yep!

I hear talk
you're kind of picky.

Yep!

Well, then, here you go!

[stomping]

[sniffing]

Mmm.

Well, Bubble Bass,
what do you think?

This is pretty good.

Only one thing

You forgot the pickles!

[all gasping]

No!

The best there is?

I don't think so.

You lose.

But the pickles should be right
where they always are.

I know I put them on.

Where are those pickles?

Pickles, pickles, pickles.

Ah!

I believe you owe me two bucks.

Two bucks!
Your guarantee.

Oh, that, well,
can we talk about this?

No.

How about a discount
on restroom tokens?

Free.

How about
a free glass of water?

A dozen free glasses of water!

I'll even put ice in it.

No, come back.

Two dollars, two dollars.
No, no.

Mr. Krabs,

I know I put pickles
on that Krabby Patty.

That two bucks is coming out
of your paycheck.

Wait.

Wait!

Get back to work.
We got orders waiting.

I need a Krabby patty.

Okay, I am not going
to blow it this time.

Let's see.

Bun down, then ketchup,
then mustard, then pickles

No, that's not right!

Bun down, mustard, then ketchup,

lettuce,
then the pickles

No.

Mustard down, bun,

oh, where does the patty go.

Pickles, ketchup, wait.

Think, think, I'm losing it.

Bun down, shoe,
mustard, pan, bun.

No.

Mr. Krabs, I am so confused.

I can't remember
how to do anything.

Why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

Oh, no, Mr. Krabs.

Who will make
the Krabby Patties?

Oh, don't worry about that.
We got Squidward.

Huh? What?

Mr. Krabs is right.

I need to get my head straight.

Now is it bun, patty, ketchup.

Ah!

The door, the door.

Mr. Krabs,
the front door is missing!

Oh.

Ha, ha, sorry about that
Mr. Krabs.

This pickle thing
has got my head all messed up.

I better get on home
and rest my brain.

Which way do I live?

Of course.

Ha! Ha!

No, no, was it bun, patty, bun?

Let's see.
Tomato, pickle, bun? No.

Bun, no.

Bun, no, shoe.

Oh, I am so confused.

Maybe a good night's sleep

will help me get my head
on straight.

Oh, was it mattress,
mattress, sheets, pillow,

then SpongeBob.

Oh, think Sponge.

Oh, yeah, it was mattress,
SpongeBob, mattress,

then sheets, pillow.

Goodnight, Gary.
Meow.

No, this isn't right.

Goodnight, Gary.
Meow.

Wait, this isn't right, either.

Nope.

Uhuh.

Negative.

Come on, come on, get it right.

Wrong, wrong.

Wrong!

Nope. Naw!

Negatory.

[rooster crowing]

[horn blowing]

Oh, I almost had it.

[horn continues to blow]

Come on, clock.

How do I turn this thing off?

Think! Think! Think! Think!

Meow.

Gary.

[horn continues]

[choking]

[bell rings]

Patties are done.

Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.

He burnt my fries.

[slurping]
He burnt my shake.

[muttering angrily]

No, come back. No, no.

I got to get SpongeBob back.

SpongeBob?

SpongeBob!

Mr. Krabs, hello.

Do you how do?

Why are you talking funny, man?

I anything can't do right
since because pickles.

Nonsense.

You'll be back
making Krabby Patties

like your old self in no time.

I think don't ready back
to go to work, Mr. Krabs.

Well, you're fine, me boy.

[crash]

Ooh, well, maybe not.

All we need to do
is get your confidence back.

So you can make me more money.

I mean, patties.

I how do that?

It's like riding a bike.
You never forget.

Uh, I'm going to help you.

You learn to make your
Krabby Patty again,

you'll life will be back
in order.

Mr. Krabs, I don't know if...
Take your time.

No, no, no, no.

Hmm...

[snoring]

I got it. I got it!

It's all very clear to me now,
Mr. Krabs.

It is?

Yes, I finally realize
that I can't do it.

I can't do it, Mr. Krabs.

I'm a failure.

Don't talk like that!

Don't you get it,
you crustaceous cheapskate

I can't make
a double Krabby Patty

with the work.

I can't put a patty on a bun
with lettuce, cheese,

onions, tomatoes,
ketchup, mustard, pickles,

and top bun together
in that order!

It's time.

Hey, SpongeBob's back.

SpongeBob!

I hear SquarePants is back.

I'm right here, Bubble Bass.

I thought
I ran you out of town.

This is where I belong.

[growls]

Roar.

[gasps]

Give me the regular.

And this time,
don't forget the pickles.

I didn't.

Mmm...

Still no pickles!

See.

Yuck.

You failed again,
SpongeBobloserpants.

[diabolical laugh]

Wait a minute.

Look.

He's been hiding the pickles
under his tongue the whole time.

And there's the pickle
from last time, too.

And there's my car keys.

And there's my ride.

Three cheers for the return
of our Mr. Fry Cook, SpongeBob.

Hiphip
Hooray!

Hiphip

Hooray!

Hip!
Hooray!

And three cheers
for the fry cook

who took my place
while I was gone

Squidward.

Hiphip.

[unenthusiastic response]
Hiphip.

[unenthusiastic response]

Hiphip.
Oh.

Hiphip.

Boo! You stink!
Are you ready, kids?

Aye aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

Mrs. Puff's Boating School,

where diligent students
learn the rules of the road.

Everyone, put down your books
because it's time to pick out

the hall monitor of the day!

Let's see here.

This week's hall monitor
will be...

Bart, Jimmy, no, no.

Tina, Ralph, hmm...

[gasps]

SpongeBob.

[chair squeaks]

It's jimmy.

Jimmy's the hall monitor.

Mrs. Puff,
I've done it already.

[chair squeaks]

OhPhil?

No way, Mrs. Puff.

[chair squeaks]

Uh, Tina
you're the hall monitor.

Hey, I've done it
three times already.

[chair squeaks]

BBeth...

She graduated.

[chair squeaks] Henry!

[squeak]
Vera!

[squeak]
Clayton!

[chair squeaking repeatedly]

[sighs]

All right,
I guess I have no choice.

[gulps]

The hall monitor
of the day is...

oh...

SpongeBob.

Yahoo!

Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting
for duty, ma'am.

I'm ready to assume my position
in the hall.

I will protect all that are weak
in the hall.

All rules will be enforced
in the hall.

Okay!

Just take the hat and belt.

I can't accept that yet, ma'am.

First, I have to make my speech.

You can't make this easy,
can you?

Classmates!

Who am I
to deserve such a great honor?

Why, I would be nothing

without Mrs. Puff.

Give me a break.

And to my public,

all I can say is I'm touched.

And furthermore,
I will carry out my duties...

crime and punishment,

punishment
and crime in the hall,

which reminds me
of an extremely long speech

written by the greatest
hall monitor of all time.

"Friends, students,
juvenile delinquents,

lend me your ears."

[snoring]

In conclusion
and without a moment to spare,

I will put on this uniform
and assume my duties as...

Hall monitor!

Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff.

Oh, and I will be...

[bell rings]

SpongeBob, are you okay?

I overdid the speech again,
didn't I?

I'm afraid so.

Aw, tartar sauce!

I guess I won't be needing this.

I hardly knew ye.

Uh...

SpongeBob?

Yes, Mrs. Puff?

I can at least let you wear it
until tomorrow.

Yahoo!

Thanks, Mrs. Puff.

What are the consequences
of what I've just done?

[shudders]

[sighs]

[humming]
Hall.

[humming]
Monitor.

[humming]

[horns honking]

Broken traffic light.

Who's to say
my monitor duties should end

just because the bell rang?

I can be helpful anywhere.

This looks like a job
for the hall monitor!

[blows whistle]

[blowing whistle rhythmically]

What would this town do
without you, SpongeBob?

My legs!

My legs!

On patrol

I'm on patrol

Uhoh, an open window.

More seaweed medley, dear?

The fools.

They've left themselves
susceptible to danger.

I must show them
the error of their ways

through example.

[SpongeBob screams]

I'm the open window maniac!

[both screaming]

I hope you learned
a valuable lesson!

On patrol

I'm on patrol

I'm on patrol...

[gasps]

Vandals! Another crime.

[smacking his lips]

Hmm...

Strawberry.

I must act.

Patrick. Patrick!

Patrick!

My ice creamIt's alive!

[screams]

Patrick, down here.

Oh, SpongeBob, it's you.

Patrick, come down here.

SpongeBob. SpongeBob!

I'm down here.

You look funny.

Hi, SpongeBob.

That's "hall monitor" to you.

Sorry, officer.

Sorry's not good enough,
Patrick.

You've just committed a crime
and I'm taking you in.

What crime?

I'm a bad person.

[sobbing]

Extra! Extra!

Maniac strikes bikini bottom!

City paralyzed with fear!

Tell your friends.

Arm yourselves with knowledge.

Extra! Extra! Maniac...
Hmm...

"Maniac... bikini bottom...

car wrecks... breakin."

Who better to bring this maniac
to justice than me...

the hall monitor!

But I can't handle
this case alone.

Patrick, are you ready
to give up your life of crime?

I want to be good!

Hmm...

Now you just need
a symbol of authority.

Perfect.

It is our duty
to catch this maniac

and bring him to justice.

But how to proceed?

Listen, deputy,
you're an excriminal

What would you do?

Hmm...

I'd get an ice cream.

[both licking loudly]

Okay, now what?

Hmm...

This isn't working.

We've got to do something else.

Something with walkietalkies!

[squeals]

And now duty calls.

All right, deputy,
I'll go that way,

you go some different way.

Geronimo!

[imitates police siren]

[police siren approaching]

[tires squeal]

Afternoon, son.

Hello, brothers.

Son, we're looking
for the maniac.

Have you seen this man?

[screams]

It's the maniac!

Take him away, take him away.

Calm down, son,
it's just a drawing,

not the real thing.

Now we're going to show you
this picture again

and you'll tell us
if you've seen this guy,

understand?

Yeah, uhhuh.
Okay.

[screams]

Horrible!

[screams again]

[stops and starts screaming
repeatedly]

Stay indoors, son.

And take that cone off
your head.

[both chuckle]

SpongeBob.

Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!

SpongeBob here, Patrick.
Report.

I don't want to be
a policeman anymore.

I'm scared.

Get a hold of yourself, deputy.

[Patrick sobbing]

I want to go home!

Poor rookie.

All right, I'm on my way back.

Hurry, SpongeBob.

I think it's getting...

dark.

Just put on your siren,
I'll be right there.

[imitating weak siren]

[imitating loud siren]

SpongeBob, I see him.

Where is he, Patrick?

At the intersection of conch
and coral.

That's where I am.

He's right on top of me,
but I can't see him.

What's he doing?

Uh...

He's just standing there,
menacingly!

Get out of there, SpongeBob!

Yaah!

That's his maniac shriek.

He's going to attack.

[whining and sobbing]

He's acting all crazy.

Run!

Hide behind that building.

No, he's behind that building.

Quick,
hide behind that street sign.

No, wait!

The maniac
just went behind that sign.

Quick,
get under the street light.

No! wait! He's there, too!

Run for your life!

[screaming]

[sighs]
[muffled radio transmission]

Say again, deputy?

The maniac's in the mailbox.

[screams]

[screaming and babbling]

Huh,

this guy's not halfbadlooking
for a maniac.

Wait a minute, Patrick.

I'm the maniac.

[Patrick screams]

[sirens wail]

We'll take that
as a confession.

SpongeBob SquarePants,
there you are!

I turn my back on you
for one minute

and you destroy half the city!

You should be ashamed
of yourself.

You know this guy?

Of course, I do.

I'm the one who gave him
the uniform in the first place.

He's my responsibility.

Uhoh.

And in conclusion, students,

red means stop, green means go.

And SpongeBob...

Yes, Mrs. Puff?

I'd like to see you after class

six months from now.

[door slams]

Ah, jellyfish fields.

Here we find SpongeBob

once again stalking
the wild jellyfish.

SpongeBob?

Hello? SpongeBob?

HmmHe's supposed
to be here somewhere.

Aha!

[jellyfish buzzing like a bee]

Safety first.

Aha! I finally got you.

[splatting]

[jellyfish moos]

[buzzing]

Ah,

there is nothing better than
the taste of natural jelly

from a jellyfish.

See you later!

Oh...

Oh, my glasses.
Thanks, little guy. Bye.

I can't play anymore, jellyfish.
I got to get home.

No, you can't come home with me.

[steps squeaking
like SpongeBob's]

Jellyfish,
you've got to stay here.

[buzzing]
Hey!

Stay!

Stay!

[jellyfish giggling]

Jellyfish, for the last time,

you cannot come home with me!

Aw, what the heck.

Squidward, hey, Squidward!

Squidward!

Squidwardiard!

Squidward, look at my new pet.

That's no pet,
that's a wild animal.

No, he isn't. Watch this.

Fetch.

How many fingers
am I holding up?

[hums deeply three times]

Play dead.

[bell tolls]

I wouldn't let that thing
in my house

even if it was pottytrained.

[humming casually]

I didn't need to see that.

Well, we're going to my house
to have a little fun.

How can you possibly have fun
with a jellyfish?

[techno music
with heavy bass playing]

[techno music
continues blasting]

SpongeBob is the only guy

I know that can have fun
with a jellyfish

for 12 hours!

Ugh...

Wow! You sure like to dance.

Well, that's enough for tonight.

It's time to go to bed.

[jellyfish buzzing]

[music blasting]

Huh?

You've got it all wrong,
little fellow.

[music starts again]

Bed! Repeat after me...

[buzzing]
Bed.

We'll just keep you right here.

[meows]

Quit worrying, Gary.
He'll be just fine.

Good night, everybody.

[snoring]
[droning loudly]

[snoring]
[meows]

[buzzing gibberish]

[meows]

[giggling]

[meows]

[rooster crows]

Mmm...

Good morning, Gary.

Good morning, jellyfish.

Jellyfish? Jellyfish?

Here, jellyfish!

Oh, jelly!

[meows wetly]

Oh, jellyf...

[yelling]

[techno music playing]

Where'd you all come from?

Okay, that's it. Party is over!

You guys have overstayed
your welcome.

This music is way too loud.

[screams]

Very funny.

I'm serious.

[rumbling and crackling]

[grumbling]

Eighteen hours!

I'm going to give that SpongeBob
a piece of my mind.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

SpongeBob, listen to me,

you squareheaded assault
on my ears.

I've had enough of this!

Strawberry.

Two can play at this.

[inhales deeply]

Come on, guys,
enough is enough.

Huh?

[clarinet playing squeaky
version of "row your boat"]

[screams]

Hey, take it easy! Ow!

Okay, I'll talk to him.

Squidward, would it be possible

to play your clarinet
a little better?

I don't think
the jellyfish like it.

The jellyfish don't like...

wha... why sure, pal.

I can play better.

Okay,
he said he'll play better.

[Squidward inhales deeply]

[playing loud, blaring note]

Uhoh, that's not better.

Hey, take it easy with that!

[playing gurgly rendition
of "row, row, row your boat"]

[clarinet squeaks]
Uh, waitI can turn it down.

[Squidward yelling,
electricity crackling]

[knock at door]

Everybody's a critic.

You won't be hearing
from me anymore.

Hey, now, that wasn't nice.

[boat horn blows]

Okay, that is it!

Everybody out!

[groaning]

[groaning again]

[music stops]

[gulps]
[buzzing]

Uh, wait... hold on.

Uh, wait.

Ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

[yelling]

[electricity crackling]

[yelling]

Come on, Gary.

[deep rumbling]

Gary, you were right.

Thanks for not rubbing it in.

[buzzing loudly]

[teeth chattering]

[clicking]

Huh?

They stopped?

[clicking]

Gary, don't stop shaking it!

[jellyfish humming peacefully]

[gurgling in tempo]

[rattling in tempo]

[clicking in tempo]

[playing bass riff]

[singing]

[slide guitar playing]

[trumpets join in]

[clicking]

[everybody strumming,
clicking, rattling or singing]

Today SpongeBob has learned

one of the sea's
harshest lessons

wild animals can throw
very wild parties.

[screeching with pain]

Ooh, I felt that.
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

Hey, Sandy! Hey, Sandy!

Hey, Sandy.

[loud whirring]

Wow!

Howdy, SpongeBob!
How do you like it?

What is it?

It's a rocket ship, duh!

I'll meet you downstairs
and show you around.

Wow! What are you going
to do with it?

I'm going to the moon,
SpongeBob.

The moon!

Can I go?

No way, SpongeBob,

especially after your little
mishap with my whirlybird.

Besides, there's not
enough room for you.

But I don't take up
that much space.

See?

I can fit in here.

Mmm... Cozy.

I need that drawer.

Well, how about this,
or this, or this?

SpongeBob,
this isn't for funSee this?

This is science.

I don't have time
for fun and games,

and I don't have time
for stowaways.

Fine. Put me in the brig.

I don't mind.

That's the air bed, SpongeBob.

I need that, too.

Oh, please, can I go?
Can I, can I, huh, please?

All right,

y'all can ride in the cargo
hold if you just...

Yeah!

Going to the moon!

Moonride, moonride, moonride!

But this time,

just don't touch anything,
okay?

Wow! Look at that popgun.

Are we going to go hunting
aliens on the moon?

Oh, hush, silly.

This is for harvesting
moon rocks.

When you're done
playing with rocks,

you could use that for some
serious alien hunting.

Aliens? Are you nuts?

I've been to the moon.
There are no aliens.

Sandy, sandy, sandy.

How can you be so naive?

There's evidence all around us.

How do you explain Atlantis,
cowlicks, 99cent stores?

And how about those
mysterious circles

that pop up in kelp fields
overnight?

Aah! There's one now.

SpongeBob,

you don't know the first thing
about outer space.

Now go home
and get some shuteye.

Be here tomorrow
at the crack of dawn

and leave your crazy
alien notions behind.

[snoring]

[alarm clock ticking loudly]

Oh, hurry up!

This ought to do the trick.

Hiya, SpongeBob.

What is it, Patrick?

Can't you see
I'm sleeping here?

Well, I know you're going
on that moon trip tomorrow,

and I just wanted
to bring you something.

A present?

No.

Uh... SpongeBob?

Is sandy's rocket alienproof?

There are no aliens, Patrick.

Just ask sandy.

Well, I guess
you won't be needing

this alien repellent
for your trip.

Alien repellent?

Let me see that.

"New alienout!
Window Protectant.

Does not stop burglars."

Well, I guess
you're right, Patrick.

We better go
spray those windows.

Look how big it is, SpongeBob!

It's pretty impressive,
all right.

Come on!

We're just here to spray
the windows, Patrick.

Wow!

How do you think we get inside?

We don't.
We're just spraying the...

windows.

I opened it, SpongeBob!

Come on!

Holy sea cow, SpongeBob.

This must be the control room.

Yeah,
just don't touch anything.

Look, I'm winning!

Patrick, cut that out.

Patrick, come on.

We can't hang around in here.

This is sandy's big rocket,
not some kind of fun house.

Whoo! Winner.

Yeah, high score!

Hey, Patrick,
what game was that, anyway?

I don't know,
but let's see what this does.

Patrick,
I don't think we should...

I like rockets.

More, more!

No more.

Okay, one more.

Okay, that's enough. Let's go.

Wait, I think
this one starts it.

Patrick, what are you doing?

I'm the space traveler here,
and I happen to know

that that particular button
is right over here.

[engine roaring]

We've started the rocket!

[sirens blaring]

Oh, SpongeBob.

[sirens wailing]

[screaming]

Hang on, buddy!

Hey, we stopped falling.

Look, we're in space now!

Whee!

[moaning dizzily]

Hey, somebody get me down
or up, or something.

[laughing]

Hey, SpongeBob, watch this.

Hey, you got your toothpaste
in my peanut butter.

[laughing]

Patrick, I can do this.

Hey, who turned
the heavy back on?

We must be landing.

All right.

Sometimes that SpongeBob

is as dumb
as a sack of peanuts.

[squeaking]

Oh, it sure looks
a lot like home.

Hey, look, it's Gary.

Come here, Gary, Gary.

Wait!
Don't go near him, Patrick.

Can't you see
this is all a trick?

The aliens are projecting
our memories

onto the environment.

They're trying
to confuse us, Patrick.

So you mean to say
they've taken what we thought

we think and make us think
we thought our thoughts

we've been thinking
our thoughts

we think we thought?

We think?

Okay, but I'm not going
to fall for it.

[meow]

Yeah!

You got him, SpongeBob.

Won't Sandy be proud?

Sandy...
I forgot all about her.

Oh, she's going to hate us
for stealing her rocket.

But won't she feel silly

when I bring her back
a real live alien?

Oh, she'll love me.

Come on, Patrick,
the more the merrier.

[bell rings]

Alien hunting, alien hunting!

Shh, Patrick,

don't let them know
we're on to them.

Uh... Yeah, alien hunting
I saw that on TV, too.

Gee, Patrick, let's drop
in on our old pal Squidward

and see what he's up to.

Make sure your gun is pumped.

[snoring]

Look at it, Patrick.

It's disgusting.

[snoring]
[mutters]

Mmm... Grandma.

It's even uglier up close.
Let's begin the analysis.

Wait... What's that?

I think I'm going to be sick.

Patrick, do you know
what this thing is?

Stinky.

No, it's an egg sac.

Let's look at the embryo.

Twins.
Twins.

[mumbling]

Pardon my French,
but get this thing off me!

[screaming]

Patrick and SpongeBob,

get out of my bedroom
and give me back my tentacles.

It's awake!

Let's capture
the little phony.

Oh, get away from me.

[yelling]

[yelling and noise inside]

Ahoy, there, lads.

Up a bit late to be
playing pirate, aren't ye?

[laughing]

[gasps]

Wait, don't shoot.

Okay, okay, shoot me,
but don't take me money.

We don't want your money,
moon man.

Look at them squirming
around in there.

Ooh...

Gross.

Well, plenty more
where those came from.

Shh!

SpongeBob, what are you
doing here so late?

Whatever this is...

it's going
on your permanent record.

[moaning and whining]
This is ridiculous!

Please let me out of here!

Ouch! Ow!

[captives all squawking]

SpongeBob, I think we might
have to make a second trip.

There's no time for that
just push harder.

SpongeBob,
what are y'all doing?

I can't turn my back on you
for two seconds

without you causing
a whole mess of trouble.

Well, look at you, bagging up
all your friends and neighbors,

just like
there was a fresh crop

of hickorysmoked sausages.

You done turned
my little science experiment

into a disaster.

You two ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

Nice try, Sandy.

Or should I say,
miss alien pants?

[laughing]

Aliens?
Is that what this is about?

This isn't the moon.

We're still in Bikini Bo...

Just goes to show you,
you can't trust anyone.

So, you were an alien
all the time

and you didn't even tell me.

I didn't even know.

Yeah? Well, I got you now.

Oh, but it's not you
that's got me, it's...

[popgun pops]

Me that's got me.

Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on Sandy's face.

[motor conks out]

Sandy, I'm back.

Wow!

Bikini Bottom
sure looks different.

Uhoh.

SpongeBob, we aliens
would like a word with you.

Pearl is my daughter,
I'll spit in your eye

Oh, ho, Pearl's a whale,
and it's her birthday

Tadah!

Thanks for the show, dad.

Now can we open the presents?

Oh, all right.

Presents for me darling
little sardine.

There you are.

Oh, you shouldn't have.

What is it, daddy?

It wouldn't be those totally
hip new flipper slippers

all my friends are wearing.

Everyone wants them.

Uh...

Uh...

It might be.

Whee! Oh, you shouldn't have!

Yay, you shouldn't have!

I mean, dad,
you really shouldn't have.

[friends laughing]

Pearl, those are the finest
fishing boots available.

Dad, you ruined me.

[wailing]

But I got them for a bargain.

[pearl wailing]

Oh, what am I going to do?

I spent two whole dollars
on these boots

and now I'm stuck with them.

Oh, uh, Mr. Krabs,
can I get my paycheck?

Spongeboymebob!

Come in, come in,
right this way, laddie.

Have a seat anywhere

but not on these beautiful,
priceless boots.

So you want your pay.

Uh, sir, I can't see you.

The boots...

are in... the way.

In the way?

These boots
never leave my sight.

These are the most expensive
and prized possessions I own.

Wow, really?

Why is that?

They look just like
any old ordinary boots.

Ordinary boots?

These are the only official
fry cook boots.

Only the finest fry cooks
in the world

are permitted to wear them,
part of a tradition.

And these boots
were given to me

by the most famous fry cook
in the sea.

Who's that?

Uh... Uh...

Uh... Well,
his name is not important.

But he was famous, all right,
don't you worry.

I'm ready, I'm ready,
I want those boots!

Sorry, son, these boots
are far too valuable.

Hmm... I know.

What if I give you
my Krusty Krab paycheck?

Paycheck! You got a deal!

And what if I paint
the Krusty Krab for free?

You got a deal!

And I'll throw in a year's
supply of French fry oil.

You got... Hold on there, lad.

You're going to give me
a heart attack.

Whoa!

You got yourself a deal.

[squeaking]

[blowing]

[squeaking continues]

Uh...

Hey, Squidward...

[boots squeaking]

Do you like my new boots?

Pretty cool, huh?

Now I'm an official fry cook.

Uh...

[boots squeaking]

[groaning]

That squeaking
is going to drive us all crazy!

Nonsense, Squidward.

That squeaking
is money to my ears...

I mean, music.

Ah...

Money, money,
money, money, money.

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty...

[squeaking]

Wha... Who's there?

[chuckles]

Back to counting me money.

[register dings]

One, two, three, four, five...

[squeaking]

What the barnacle is that, huh?

[hinge squeaks]

Ah...

[cries out]

[yelling]

[splashes]

[footsteps approaching]

Argh... Oop...

Careful.

[grunting]

[sighs]

[yawning]

[cries out]

[yelling]

[squeaks]

[moaning, hinge squeaking]

Argh...

That was the worst night
I ever weathered.

At least I'll have some peace
and quiet at work.

Watch it, Mr. Krabs,
I'm taking my vacation now.

What's wrong, Mr. Squidward?

I can't take the world's
greatest fry cook anymore!

I'll see you in a week.

That fry cook
is making me a fortune.

What could be the problem?

Hey, Mr. Krabs.

SpongeBob...

Bob.. Bob... Bob...

[squeaking]
Bob...

Bob... Bob...

[boots squeaking]

I, uh, see you're still
wearing them boots.

Are you kidding? I love them!

Could the world's
greatest fry cook do this?

[squeaking]

Well, uh, I don't, uh...
I don't, uh...

Or could he do this?

Or this?

And watch this, Mr. Krabs.

[squeaking]
Can I take your order?

Yeah,
I'll have the Krusty special.

[squeaking]
Thank you, sir.

I will squeak when it's ready.

Could the greatest fry cook
do that, Mr. Krabs?

I, uh...

And look at this, Mr. Krabs.

And this.

And this... And this...

And this... And this...

And this... And this...

And this... And this...
And this... And this...

[screaming]

I got to go to my office!

[boots continue squeaking]

I can still hear it!

[squeaking continues]

It's still coming through!

The infernal squeak!

Those boots have got to go!

And I need an aspirin.

Gary, these boots
have changed my life.

I'm never taking them off.

[meows]

Good night, Gary.

[squeaking]

[snoring]

[snoring squeakily]

Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar...

[hammering]

[rooster crows]

Ah...

Quiet money.

[sniffs]

Silence and money.

[door opens]

Mr. Krabs!

What is it, my boy?

Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry,
sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.

It's okay, son.

[wailing]

No, it's not okay!

I lost the boots,
your valuable boots.

It's my fault. I let you down!

[bawling]

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

Ooh, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

Hold it, boy,
it's not the end of the world.

Yes, it is.

Look, don't cry.

I've got some, uh...

Some magic oven mitts.

[pop]

[pop]

They're not the same!

You were right

I wasn't ready
for those blessed boots.

[thud]

Poor lad.

[sizzling]

Excuse me.

I didn't do it!

Oh...

[chuckles nervously]

Could I help you?

Yeah, I'm ready to order.

What'll you have?

I'll take a [squeaks]

What did you say?

I said I'll take a [squeaks]

Huh?

I heard his order, Mr. Krabs.

He said he wants [squeaks]

What?
And a [squeaks]

[squeaking]

[gasps]
[squeaking]

What?

[squeaking]

[gasps]

[ticking squeakily]

What?

[squeaking]

I didn't write that!

[squeaking getting louder]

[thunder crashes]

[squeaking]

[gasps]
[squeaking]

Who said that?

What?
[thunder crashes]

Could the world's
greatest fry cook do this?

And this... And this...

And this... And this...

And this... And this...

Stop it!

Stop it!

Don't you hear it?

Yes, I did it! I did it!

I took the boots!

They're here
under the floorboard!

Oh, please, make it stop!

It's the squeaking
of the hideous boots!

[bawling]

I'm sorry,

but I can't take
the infernal squeaking no more!

[belches]

The deed is done.

Um...

Why did you eat my boots,
Mr. Krabs?

Because, lad,
you didn't need them.

It's not the boots,
it's the bootee, uh...

I mean the person in the boots.

You're a great fry cook.

You really think so,
Mr. Krabs?

I do, son.

Here's your paycheck I owe you,
plus a bonus.

Well,
there's your paycheck anyway.

I need a vacation.

Bye, Mr. Krabs.

Ah...

A long week away
from Bikini Bottom

is exactly what I need,

just me and my darling
daughter, Pearl.

Oh, don't forget
my new flipper slippers, daddy.

Darling, I won't.

[laughing]

[hiccups, squeaks]

Oh, no!

[hiccupping, squeaking]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[sizzling]

[loud buzzing]

[pop]

[buzzing]

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob!

Wake up, boy!
You're burning me money!

[alarm sounds]
[yelps]

Mr. Krabs, what do we do?

Here, use this.

[grunts]
[clang]

[flames whoosh]

[blowing frantically]

[teeth chattering]

[imitating fire alarm]

[gurgling]

Hooray!
Hooray!

[steam whistling]

[sizzles]

SpongeBob,
come into me office.

What's wrong, boy?
Well, I...

This is the fourth time
this week

I've had to scrape you off
of something.

Well, I've been thinking.

We need to get you thinking
about work.

No offense, Mr. Krabs,
but I've been thinking

about giving up
my cold industrial life

in favor of a more natural
and free life

among the jellyfish.

[laughs heartily]

[laughter echoes]

Ah...

SpongeBob, you wouldn't last
even one day in the wild.

This is your natural habitat.

This is your wideopen range.

These are your amber waves.

And this...

Oh, this is your golden scepter
with which you rule!

That's better than nasty old
jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob?

Oh, I can too last
more than one day.

I'll show him.

Aw, barnacles!

SpongeBob, wait.

[screams]

Oh, he'll be back, all right.

He'll be back.

And, Squidward, I want
you to have my can opener.

And I thought this friendship
would never pay off.

Are... Are... Are...

Are you sure you want
to give me this mayonnaise?

It's all yours.

And these old phone books?

All yours, old friend.

Patrick,
there is one more thing

I want you to have.

[gasps]

[panting with excitement]

Ol' reliable?

[sobs]

Howdy, y'all.

Hey, SpongeBob,
you having a garage sale?

No, sandy, I'm giving up
my material possessions

to live in the wild
with the jellyfish.

SpongeBob,
of all the crazy schemes,

why would you want to live
among the jellyfish?

They're cold and mean
and none too bright.

Oh, Sandy,

that's exactly the response
I would expect from someone

who lives the sham of a life
I once lived.

I'm gonna prove

that I don't need
all this stuff to be happy.

Maybe someday
you'll wise up and join me.

Goodbye.

[pop]

I won't be needing these.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz...

He took off his pants.

I'll give him a week.

I'll give him 11 minutes.

Patrick sad!

I'm home.

I'm home!

I'm home!

I'm home, I'm home, I'm home,
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home,

I'm home, I'm home, I'm home!

[sudden buzzing]

Brothers and sisters,
wait for me.

[buzzing]

Buzz, buzz, buzz.

Okay, I'm here.

Wait, I just got here.

My jellyfish instincts
tell me to go...

[slurps]

[pops]

That way.

Buzz, buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz, buzz...

[jellyfish buzzing]

[chomping]

[gags]

Mmm, this is the life.

Hey, everybody, buzz, buzz.
Buzz to you.

Buzz, buzz. Nice current today.

Hey, what's the buzz?

Hello, I'm JellyBob
And you are...?

[electricity crackles]

Uh...

Nice to meet you.

[sniffing]

Mmm.

Here, Patrick,
have a Krabby Patty.

[choking up]

There he is, Patrick.
Say your line.

"Why, thank you, Sandy.

I would love one.

'Take patty.'

Too bad SpongeBob isn't here.

These are his favorites.

I sure wish he'd come home.

'Take bite.'"

I can't do it!

SpongeBob!

Come back!

Patrick, I'm not coming home.

I miss you.

Sandy misses you.

Even Squidward misses you.

Whoopee!

[party music playing]

I'm happy here.

This is my home now.

[sandy grunting]

[sobbing]

SpongeBob!

[buzzing]

Hey, everybody, I'm back.

I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

[panting heavily]

Patrick, what are you doing?

If I can't have you
as a friend,

I'm going to make you a trophy.

I even picked out
this nice jar for you.

Patrick, go home.

I'm a jellyfish now.

[gurgling cry]

[panting]

Wow!

[continues gurgling cry]

I can see you there.

I still see you.

You're going to look good
on my mantel.

Friends forever, SpongeBob!

[panting slowing down]

Ahh.

I got you now, SpongeBob.

[straining]

Patrick, no!

[SpongeBob panting]

[Patrick yelling]

[grunting]

Okay!

So this is the way
it's going to be.

I hope you're happy.

[groans]

Well, that's over.

Back to jellyfish matters.

[drip]

Mmm, jelly.

[buzzing]

Ah, my jellyfish brethren
are returning.

Greetings, comrades.

[electricity crackles]

[screams]

Ow! Ooh!

Ow! Ow!

Being a jellyfish sure is fun.

Buzz...

Buzz...

[crack]
Buzz.

[shivering]

[pop]

[resumes shivering]

Hey!

Ew, I'm itchy.

ItchyWhy am I so itchy?

[screams]

Poison sea urchins.

Ow, ow, itch, itch,
itch, itch, ow.

Ooh, ow, ow, ow, itch, itch,
itch, itch, itch, itch...

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz...

[thud]

[muffled]
Krabby Patties.

Buzz...

[sniffs]
Buzz...

[sniffs]

Sandy...

Buzz, buzz, buzz...

[sniffs]
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz...

What have I done?

I had a great life and friends,
and I gave all of that up.

Welcome home, SpongeBob!

You guys are the best.

I made a huge mistake.

Please forgive me.

Ah, quit your blubbering
and have a Krabby Patty.

Don't mind if I do.

And I'll see you at work
first thing tomorrow morning.

Aye, aye, captain!

SpongeBob,
do us all a favor...

Don't mind if I do.

[snaps pants loudly]

Tadah!

Aw.

Okay, that's enough.

[growls affectionately]

[meows]

Could we please stop this?

Patrick itchy.

Ooh! Ow! Oh! Ow! Ooh!

It is great to be home!

[crowing]

[snoring]

[SpongeBob
and Patrick jabbering]

Huh?
[jabbering stops]

[jabbering resumes]

Huh?

[blows]

Surprise!

Happy birthday, Squidward!

Happy, happy birthday!

Happy birthday cake!

Happy, happy birthday!

Pin the tail
on the sea horse!

Happy, happy birthday!

Happy birthday, Squidward!

[SpongeBob cheering]

So long, Squidward, byebye.

Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

Another year older.

It's not my birthday!

That's it!

I'm moving
out of this neighborhood.

Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles.

I can sell your home
in a heartbeat.

Oh, that's great news

because I want to move
as soon as possible.

No problem.

As long as it's not infested
with nematodes

or surrounded
by troublesome neighbors

or something like that.

Oh, sure,
there's none of that.

Did you say neighbors?
Of course!

I can't tell you how many times
I've seen a sale fall through

because of bad neighbors.

Neighbors, uh...

Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow
to check out the house.

See you then.

SpongeBob.

No one will ever buy my house
with him living next door.

Whatever
a good neighbor would do,

he does the opposite.

Opposite.

Opposite.

[rooster crowing]

[cacophonous music playing]
[yells]

[playing loudly]

Uh, Squidward...

Why are you playing the drum?

Drum?

What drum?

This is just my wig case, see?

[cackles]

Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!

Squidward, you need bed rest.

I'll keep you safe
until you're well again.

Oh, I get it.

You don't know what day it is,
do you?

Uh, Wednesday?

Why, it's opposite day.

You may you never heard of it?

Boy, have you been missing out.

Opposite day
is the one day of the year

when you get to act different.

Normally I'm stuffy and boring,

but today I'm silly
and spontaneous.

[giggles]

Does everybody know
about opposite day?

Oh, sure.

It's a game, get it?

Oh, a game.

Yeah.

Normally, you're really loud
and annoying,

so what are you going
to be today?

Quiet and out of the way.

Yay!

Yeah.

Why don't you get a jump on it.

I love...

[gruffly]
I mean, I hate opposite day.

[giggles]

[yelling]
I'm not ready.

So long, chum.

And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
[door slams]

Gary, it's opposite day
and I'm

Walk, don't run.

And I'm going to...

Opposite, opposite.

I'm just going
to crawl into bed

and do nothing all day.

Too bad it only comes
once a year, huh, Gary?

[meows]

Gary,
where's your holiday spirit?

[barks]

[doorbell rings]

Company!

I hate company.

Who's there?

It's Patrick.

Patrick.

Go away!

I never want to see you again!
[giggles]

[whimpers]

[sobbing]

SpongeBob
doesn't like me anymore.

That's right.

You're my worst enemy.

[sobbing]

Patrick, you're not really
not my friend.

It's just opposite day.

Opposite day?

Hey, I've heard of that.

You have?

No, what is it?

Well,
whatever you normally do,

today you do the opposite.

Let me try, let me try.

[straining]

[still straining]

Patrick! Patrick, breathe!

[exhales loudly]

[gasping]

Not that opposite.

Let me show you how to do it,
the wrong way.

Meow.

Meow.

[speaking gibberish]

[laughing]

Say, "Want to help me
do some work around the house,

worst enemy?"

Nope.

[laughing]

[Squidward cackles]

Nearly noon
and not a peep from SpongeBob.

I'm almost sorry I'm leaving.

[cackles]

Opposite day.

[crashing]

SpongeBob, what are you...?

[yells]

Hello, Squidward.

Oop, I mean,
goodbye, Squidward.

Isn't opposite day...

Terrible.

[laughs]

I'll tell you what's terrible
living next to you.

You're the worst neighbor
in history.

Wow!

That's the nicest thing
Squidward has ever said to me.

If the real estate agent
sees that mess,

I'll never sell this house.

Isn't it beautiful?

On opposite day it is.

[rumbling]

Out of the way, SpongeBob!

[hammer pounding]

I don't get it.

I made my house a mess,
which was making it clean,

which made Squidward
clean my yard.

But that means
he's messing it up.

But the opposite of clean
is filth,

which means filth is clean.

That means Squidward's
really making my yard a wreck.

But I'd normally wreck
my own yard,

which means Squidward's being
the opposite of Squidward,

which means he's SpongeBob.

Aha!

I understand everything now.

I must be the opposite
of SpongeBob by being...

Squidward.

Hey...

I want to be opposite, too.

Yeah, finally!

Yoohoo!

I'm Squidward,
I'm Squidward

Squidward, Squidward,
Squidward.

Wait.

It's not enough to look like
Squidward to be opposite.

[imitating Squidward]
You have to act like him, too.

Boy, oh, boy,
do I like playing the clarinet.

I practice and practice
all day long,

but I never get any better.

Now you try.

Okay.

[inhales]

I'm Squidward, Squidward,
Squidward, Squidward

I'm Squidward,
I'm Squidward

I'm Squidward, Squidward.

After you, Mr. Squidward.

Fine.
Thank you, Mr. Squidward.

You're quite welcome,
Mr. Squidward.

Opposite day.

Next time, it's going to be
"Go jump off a cliff" day.

[tires squeal]

Oh, my.

The house is even more
beautiful in person.

Hello, mist...

Um, Mr. Tentacles?

Yes, please come in.

It's funny. I pictured
you being much taller.

Yeah, everyone says that.

Now if you want the sale
to go through,

you've got to tell me
all the positive things

about your house.

Positive things
Opposite day.

I'd love to.

The floor creaks,
the roof leaks.

There's a terrible draft.

Uh...

Well, you didn't mention
that on the phone.

Please let me finish.

The winters are hard.

The summers are brutal.

There's a wild maneating clam
in the backyard.

Would you care to see
the rest of my home?

Well, I'm not sure
if I'm interested.

Nonsense.

I won't take no for an answer.

[honking]

Please follow me.

And here's the worst room
in the house, my gallery.

Oh, my,
this painting is very nice.

Thank you.
[screams]

Who's that?

I'd like to introduce
you to Mr. Squidward.

You're both Squidward?

I'm Squidward. He's Squidward.

We're both Squidward.

[sighs]
Well, that's done.

At least SpongeBob
has been quiet.

[screams]
No!

[playing squeakily]

Okay, I really don't want
to hear another one.

Okay.
[tooting]

I really don't want
to hear more, thank you.

I hear you loud and clear.

[tooting]

Stop!

Get away from her!

Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am.

I hope these two barnacleheads
haven't harmed you in any way.

Who are you?

Fine. I'm Squidward.

What kind of fool
do you take me for?

He's Squidward? He's Squidward?

You're Squidward?

I'm Squidward!

Are there any other Squidwards
I should know about?

Meow.

I'm out of here.

Ma'am, please.

What about my house?

I wouldn't sell a house
for you

if you were the last Squidward
on Earth!

Wait!

Don't...
Go!

[screams]

No, no, no!

Please sell my house.

Never!

Don't leave me here!

[crying]

Happy opposite day, Squidward.

We hate you.

Let me show you guys

how much I hate you.

[engine revs]

[yelling]

Patrick, you ever feel

that Squidward likes us
too much?

Happy opposite day!
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[sighs dreamily]

[gasps]

[grunting]

[gasps]

[grunting]

Hmm.

Hmm...

I just don't get it.

If a free salad bar
doesn't bring in customers,

what will?

[humming tune]

Squidward!

Uh, uh, yes, sir?

There's going to be
some changes around here.

[gasps] A customer!

Welcome to the Krusty Krab!

SpongeBob,
cater to his every whim

and don't screw this one up.

Aye, aye, sir!

Welcome aboard, sir.

Here at the Krusty Krab,
you are the captain,

and I am your cabin boy.

You just say the word,

and I will throw myself
in the brig.

May I take your order?

All I wanted was change
for the pay phone.

Aye, aye, sir!

"Monsieur's Changez."

Thanks.

[laughs nervously]

Here you go.

[sniffs]

[cash register rings]
Yeah!

[penny clinks]

As you may have noticed,
profits are way down this month.

We need a gimmick
to bring in customers.

Do you lubbers have any ideas?

I've got one

a free pair of socks
with every purchase.

Uhuh.

Or maybe Double Patty
Midnight Madness!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

I know! I know! I know!

How about
"mouthful of clams" day?

Everyone who shows up
with a mouthful of clams,

gets a free drink.

Huh? Huh?

Well, uh...

I was thinking
more along the lines

of live entertainment.

That's it.

A floor show!

No, wait, a talent show
with your host

me!

Oh, this is the moment I've...

I mean, we've been dreaming of.

Think of it, Mr. Krabs,
you will be responsible

for bringing culture
into this cultural wasteland

we call Bikini Bottom.

[quietly]
And not to mention the money.

The money?

And I can see it now.

Your daughter, Pearl
her name up in lights.

Little Pearliea star?

Hopping clams!

A talent show!

I'm talented!

I'd better call the folks.

Squidward, you've got a deal.

Make my little girl a star.

Hey, Squidward,
what time am I going on?

Going on what?

The show!

When am I going on the show?

I have a great act.

What talent
could you possibly possess?

[blowing]

[shoes tapping]

Tadah!

[yawns]

No one, not even your parents,
would want to see that.

What the people want is culture,
not dancing bubbles.

Okay, I get it.

Don't worry, Squidward.

I'm going to come up
with the most cultured act ever!

[sarcastically]
I can hardly wait.

Phew!

The only culture that guy
has is in his tennis shoes.

Ha, ha!

Tennis shoesha, ha!

I crack myself up.

We are live
at the Krusty Krab talent show

featuring the finest talent...

Wow! A full house.

[gasps] There's mom and dad.

They are going to be so proud!

Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs,
and I like money.

I got to get ready.

All right, listen up,
people, listen up.

Gather around, everyone.

Now, you may be thinking

this is your one shot
at the big time.

Well, it's not.

It's mine.

Hey, Squid,
how about this for the show?

The amazing Mr. Absorbency!

[sucking water]

Whoa!

Tadah!

Tadah!

No one is going to want to see
you engorge yourself.

Please, Squidward,
let me be in the show.

I'll do anything,
anything, anything!

So you really want to be
in the show?

Oh, yes!

Okay, you get
to mop up afterwards.

Now will you stop bugging me?

So this is what it feels like
the big time.

With this mop,
I shape my destiny!

[applause]

[clears throat]

Good evening, and welcome

to the first annual
Squidward Tentacles Talent Show,

sponsored by the Krusty Krab,

home of the Krabby Patty

because no one else
would give it a home.

[laughing]

Uh... Thank you.

Our next act is living proof
that nepotism is alive and well.

[laughing uproariously]

Nepoti... [laughing]

Ha... Thank you.

Put your fins together for...

[laughing]

Put your...
[Patrick laughing]

Put...
[Patrick laughing]

Pearl!

Hooray!

My little girl
is finally a star!

Give me a KRU...

[audience cries out]

Give me a STY...

[crying out]

Krusty Krab!

[crying out]

Krusty Krab!

[crying out]

Krusty Krab!

Now that's what I call talent!

[loud crash]

Thank you!

My legs!

[audience groaning]

Thank you!

Thank you.

[yelps]

Hey, Squidward,
listen, what do you think?

When I mop,
should I go forward and back?

No, no, waitside to side.

[crash]
And now, poetry...

by Gary.

[clears throat]

[meowing]

[sighs dreamily]

He has such a way with words.

[meowing slowly]

Come on, come on, Ginsberg.

If he doesn't hurry it up,

we're not
going to have enough time

for the best actme!

Squidward, should I use
Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?

Yes.

[applause]

I, The Amazing Plankton

with the use of prestidigitation

will make
a Krabby Patty disappear

before your very eyes.

First, I'll need a volunteer
from the audience.

Nice try.

Your act's over, Bub.

You may win this time.

Sheeah kazing!

Well, this stinks.

[audience booing]

Get out!

Get off the stage!

Squidward!

This show is a disaster!

You're ruining me!

No, no, don't you worry,
Mr. Krabs.

I've saved the best
for lastyou'll see.

For your sake,
I hope you're right.

And now, ladies and gentlemen,

the moment
you've all been waiting for.

We've saved the best for last.

Put your hands together

for the incomparable Squidward!

[synthesized music playing]

[Squidward gurgling]

What the...?

[babbling rhythmically]

[audience booing]

I'm losing money on this deal.

It's worth every penny.

[booing]

You bottom feeders!

You don't even know talent!

No talent!

No talent!

No talent!

No talent!

Hey, Squidward,
can I go on now?

Yeah, show's over.

[booing continues]

[booing stops]

Hey, yeah!

That's really not too bad.

I like that.
All right!

[cheering and applause]

[cheering and applause stops]

[loud cheering and applause]

They want an encore.

Stand aside, SpongeBob.

[loud cheering]

[cheering stops]

[groaning]

[loud cheering and applause]

[cheering stops]

[cheering]

[cheering stops]

[cheering]

[cheering stops]

[cheering]

[cheering stops]

[cheering]

You did it, Squidward!

What a great show!

Oh, my son's a star.

Who ever knew
he had such talent?

I'll be needing
another wheelbarrow

for next week's show!

[groans]
[cheering]

[camera shutters clicking]

Ah,
lunchtime at the Krusty Krab

Everyone enjoying their
Krabby Patties.

[screaming]

Huh? What's this?

[screaming continues]

Can you spot her,
Mr. Squidward?

Down there, sir!

There appears to be

a Krabby Patty napping
in progress.

There can be only one culprit...

Plankton!

Finally, victory is mine.

I win, I win!

I win!

[laughing]

He got away, sir.

No!

He's finally stolen me
secret recipe.

Perhaps not,
Monsieur Krabs, for it's...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Aha!

Hey!

Okay, that's far enough.

Huh?

Tartar sauce!

Yeehaw!

Have you seen a Krabby Patty?

It's about this tall, and...

Wow, a magic shop.

Are you a magician?

One time I saw this magician
and he did this thing, and...

Anyway, and then he told us

"if you believe in yourself
and with a tiny pinch

of magic all your dreams
can come true."

[screams]

I can't take it!

Plankton, it's you!

Yes, and after all these years

I thought
I was the master of torture.

But that...

That just wasn't fair.

Here!

Take the stupid patty.

I don't want
the secret recipe anyway.

I guess my restaurant

will never be
as good as the Krusty Krab.

[crying]

You don't know
what it's like to be a loser.

[sobbing]

Aw...

Cheer up, Plankton.

I think you're a winner.

What...

What did you say?

I said you're a...

Loser!

How does it feel to be

the most hated thing
in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?

It hurts, doesn't it? I know.

Yeah, and for running you out

we're going to make this kid
honorary town rookie of the day.

For he's a jolly good rookie

For he's a jolly good rookie

For he's
a jolly good rookie...

I bet
if he had just one friend,

he wouldn't be such a meanie.

[cheering]

Which nobody...

Whatever.

[knock at door]
A customer?

Our special today
is Chum... balaya.

Hi, Mr. Plankton.

Haven't you degraded me enough
for one day?

No. I mean...

I want you to come out
and play with me.

Wha...?

Play... with... me...

You know how to induce
thermonuclear fusion?

No, but I like to go...

That naive cube!

How long must I suffer this?

You're not letting him leave,
are you?

Can't you see?

This is the perfect opportunity
for revenge.

Elaborate.

Befriend the sponge bath,

then,
when the time is just right,

take the Krabby Patty!

Take...

The Krabby Patty.

Get moving, genius,
don't let him get away!

Fishing with my friends
in jellyfish fields.

All right, SpongeBob,
I'll play your little game.

Right!

Last one to the fields
is a rotten clam!

So, I get the big net
and you get the little net.

What happens after we eat them?

You don't eat them,
you catch them, like this.

La, la, la, lala,
la, la, la, lala.

Like that.
And?

Then you throw them back

But watch out for stingers.

Stingers?

[screaming]

All knees will bow to plankton.

Hail, Plankton!

I win, I win!

It's not about winning,
it's about fun.

What's that?

Fun is when you...

Fun is...

It's like...

It's kind of...

Sort of like a...

What is fun?

Let me spell it for you.

"F" is for friends
who do stuff together

"U" is for you and me

"N" is for anywhere
and anytime at all

Down here
in the deep blue sea

"F" is fire that burns down
the whole town

"U" is for uranium... Bombs

"N" is for no survivors
when you...

Plankton, those things
aren't what fun is all about.

Now do it like this.

"F" is for friends
who do stuff...

Never!

That's completely idiotic.

Here, let me help you.

"F" is for friends
who do stuff together

"U" is for you and me...

Try it!

"N" is for anywhere
and anytime at all

Down here
in the deep blue sea

Wait, I don't understand this

I feel all tingly inside.

Should we stop?

No, that's
how you're supposed to feel.

Well, I like it

Let's do it again!

Okay!

"F" is for frolic
through all the flowers

"U" is for ukulele

"N" is for nose picking,

Sharing gum and sand licking

Here with my best buddy

[both laughing
in time with music]

Argh... Mutiny.

And after that,
we frolicked through the flowers

and then we...

Sounds like fun.

Well, the really fun part
was when we...

What did you do
with the Krabby Patty?

Uh, the what?

The Krabby Patty, remember?

You can't rush these things,
you know.

You're forgetting the mission?

What are you talking about?

You're going native, Plankton.

Look at yourself.

What?

I haven't seen plankton
for a while.

He must be scheming.

Who knows?

Maybe he's changed.
Who knows?

I think you know!

He's changed, I tell you.

Sponge buddy?

Yoohoo!

Plankton buddy, let's go.

I forgot
this is a nofriends zone.

SpongeBob...

May I speak to you in private?

You won't mind
if I set this here, will you?

What's this all about,
Mr. Krabs?

He's a thief

Look at the lust in his eye,
he's...

Why can't you
just accept our friendship?

He's just after me recipe.

I'll prove it to you.

Argh, you must be hungry
after that long walk over here.

Oh, yes,
but I'm saving my appetite

for some popcorn at the movies.

Uh...

Suit yourself.

We've had enough
of your little tests, Mr. Krabs.

Come on, Plankton,
let's get out of here.

Maybe the lad was right.

Maybe Plankton's gone straight.

And maybe scallops
will fly out of my pants!

Hang on there,
laddie, I'm acomin'!

[movie soundtrack playing]

[squishing]

I sure like sequels, plankton.

Hey, Bubble Bass,
you're sitting on my friend.

[squishing]

Hey, Bubble Bass...

Thanks for that, friend.

Sure thing.

Listen up!

Mr. Krabs?

He's deceiving you!

Reach into his pocket now
and take what he's got!

You, too, boy!

[gasps]

I can't believe this.

It's not what you think.

What is it, then?

Tell me what you see here.

I...I don't see anything.

How can you not see it?

Okay, okay, I see it.

It's a Krabby Patty, okay?

I couldn't help it.

But we sang the fun song.

I think I'm going to be sick.

How long?

How long what?

How long were you planning
on doing this?

Tell me!

[crying]

What?

All right, it's true!

I tricked you
to get the Krabby Patty!

But then you
showed me friendship...

And now I realize...

That's all I ever really wanted.

Really?
No, not really.

Being evil is too much fun!

Oh, darling, I knew nothing
would ever tear us apart.

[ripping]

Mr. Krabs, he's gone.

He got the patty.

He won.

Hoho, no, he didn't, boy!

Don't you know
what's behind these screens?

Solid concrete! [laughing]

[groaning]

I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs I thought
Plankton had changed.

Don't blame him, lad.

No friendship can withstand
the allure of a Krabby Patty.

Now, let's go back
to the Krusty Krab

and have a fresh one, on me!

Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.

Well, maybe at a discount.

Huh?

[screaming]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent
and yellow and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck and flop
like a fish.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[growling and grunting]

It's time to grow myself
large and wide.

[struggling]

[grunting slowly builds up]

[groaning frenziedly]

[yells]

[doorbell rings]

Howdy, SpongeBob.

How's it going?

Not too close, Sandy.

I tend to get smelly
when I'm pumping iron.

Check it out.

Well, you're smelly.

All thanks

to my stateoftheart
weight set.

Uh...

I don't want
to disappoint you, SpongeBob,

but you won't see any
progress lifting those.

Oh, really?

That is,
if you want arms like these.

Huh?

Or these.

Or these!

Well, maybe
I could use a little help.

Well, if you want arms
like mine

you just got to follow
my training program.

Wow! Really?

That'd be great, Sandy.

I can see me now.

[humming light tune,
feet landing with thuds]

Good night, Gary.

[meows]

Yeah,
that would change everything.

Be at my place at 5:00 a.m..

Oh, and you'll need
a water helmet.

[SpongeBob grunting]

Come on, SpongeBob.

It's only pushups.

Come on, come on,
you can do it.

[grunting]

[groaning frenziedly]

[pop]

One.

[dings]

All right, put them up.

[groaning]

They're up.

Ding, ding.

[panting]

[panting quickens]

[ricocheting boings]

Feeling the burn?

I'm feeling something!

[screams]

[smack]

[squeaking]

Well, now that
we've got you warmed up,

it's time for the arm cruncher.

Arm cruncher great.

[loud slamming]

This squirrel's
trying to kill me.

This is it.

Hey, that's great, Sandy.

Oh, I sure had fun.

We'll have to do it again
sometimeBye.

[dial tone hums]

This working out thing
isn't working out.

[heartbeat throbbing]
Ow!

Ow!

Ow!

Hey! Hey, you!

Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.

"Ooh, I'm a little peanut worm."

Are you too much
of a wimp to work out?

Are you a weakling
built like a sponge?

Well, now, you, too,
can have muscles.

Huh?

With anchor arms!

They slip on like a glove.

Just add air.

[air hisses]

How big do you want them?

Normal?

Veiny?

And for the ladies...

hairy.

[whistles]

I was a wimp
before anchor arms.

Now I'm a jerk,
and everybody loves me.

So order now, wimp!

Wow...

Now, that's a good idea.

[meows]

I want to be just like him.

Yeah,
I've got to get to a phone.

[slurping]

Hi, Squidward.

[muffled] SpongeBob?

[humming]

[gasps]
Ahoy, Mr. Krabs.

Motherofpearl!

[all grunting]

[all gasp]

Ow.

Ow.

Hi, guys.

SpongeBob, is that you?

Who are you expecting?

Tiny Tim?

Wait, wait...

Big, aren't they?

Dude, you're ripped.

Thank you.

I've been working out.

Excuse me a second.

Yeah.

Anyone for the juice bar?

I'm telling you, he's huge!

Have you guys seen
SpongeBob anywhere?

You mean MuscleBob BuffPants?

He's in there.

Uh... Whatever.

Thanks.

I start off
with 20 raw eggs every day

but that's just me.

Pardon me.

Working out is my life.

I remember
when I used to look

like that guy over there.

Who, me?

[others laugh]

I remember when I used
to look like you, too.

[all laugh harder]

But that was a long time ago.

Here's your drink, sir.
Thank you.

[grunting]

Oop.

[grunting] [rattling]

[grunting]

[slurps]

Yeah.

SpongeBob?

What...

Where'd you get those muscles?

I've created
my own workout routine

that's giving me
amazing results

Oops.

Yeah, I have never felt better.

Heck, what's your secret?

What?
Your secret workout

What is it?
Yeah, he's smart.

Yeah.
[all inquire at once]

Hmm

Well, I, uh...

First I take my hand
and I do this.

[makes farting noise]

Are you kidding?

Do these muscles lie?

[all repeat imitation farting]

I'm glad to see
you've found an exercise program

that works for you.

Yeah, your workout routine

wasn't quite tough enough
for me.

Can't argue with those results.

What you need to do now

is put those muscles
to the test.

Uh... What do you mean?

The big mussel beach
anchor toss competition.

It's today.
Everybody will be there.

Here's your drink.

[air deflating]

Hey, with those arms,
you'll do great.

Uh... Well, I'm not sure.

Come on, let's go.

Right now?

Wait, wait, Sandy!

I don't think it's such a...

Sandy, wait!

[groaning]

Here it is

The signin list.

Oh, no.

Okay.

Sandy...

[grunting]

Cheeks.

[groaning]

Wait, Sandy,
don't sign just yet.

[frenzied struggling]

Okay.

Wait!

SpongeBob...

SquarePants.

[yelling wildly]

[snaps]

Oh, Sandy. Wait!

It's okay, SpongeBob.

I already signed your name in.

Oh, great.

Thanks, Sandy.

Are we on?

Welcome to the Goo Lagoon Eighth
Annual Anchor Toss Competition.

[all grunting]

[knees knocking]

Ready, SpongeBob?

Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

[blows frantically]

Can I get some mustard on that?

Oh

First up, Dom the Whale.

[all cheering]

200 yards!

Wow!

Let's see an instant replay.

Amazing!

Up next, Larry the Lobster.

[yells]

[screaming]

[panting]

210 yards!

Here goes Sandy Cheeks.

Whoa...

Yeeahh!

[fearful squealing]

[thud]

510 yards!

Wow! Fabulous.

Beat that, SpongeBob.

Up next, SpongeBob SquarePants.

[making farting noises
and chanting]

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

SpongeBob!

[struggling, grunting]

Ouch.

[audience booing, whistling]

Uh...

Just kidding.

Just kidding.

[laughter and cheering]

That SpongeBob's funnier
than ears on an acorn.

Oh, this is it.

They're all going to find out
I'm a fake.

I can't give up.
I've got to try.

I can do it!

I've got anchor arms.

I'm no wimp.

I'm a jerk!

[blows]

Yeah.

[heavy groaning]

[air hisses]

[crowd boos; air hisses]

[air hisses]

Ooh.

[air hisses, boinging]

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

[screams]

[explosion]

[air whistles as arms deflate]

Ooh.

I think he lost.

Sandy! Sandy!

Sandy! Sandy!

[chuckles weakly]

96...

97...

98...

99...

100.

I want a hundred more.

It hurts.

One, two, three, four...

I think we finally found
an exercise for you, SpongeBob.

Eight, nine, ten...

[pop]

Can you get that?

Have I told you
how beautiful you are?

Your tentacles,
your nose, your eyes...

A little lopsided.

There. Ah.

And now
that I've been immortalized

in wax I have conquered
all artistic media.

Come on,
my precious reflection, smile.

[crash]

Hike, Patrick, hike!

[SpongeBob groaning]

You just lost three points.

One... Two...

Five.

G7!

G7?

King me, king me!

I lose!

But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.

Tartar sauce!
Hey!

What are you
invertebrates doing?

We don't know.
We don't know.

Hey, Patrick,
do you know what time it is?

Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's...

Time to find
some other game to play.

[laughing]

[humming happily]

[oldtime music playing]

Ah!

Now what?

We could toss
that shell back and forth.

Okay!

Ready!

Go!

I got it, I got it.

I got it, I got it,
I got it! I got it!

[statue thumps on floor]
Huh?

[mumbles]

Remember, Patrick,
finders keepers.

There it is!

I got it! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

Bonus points.

Uh, Patrick?

I think something's wrong
with Squidward.

He looks unconscious.

Don't worry.

I know how to do this.

[inhaling deeply]

[breath squeaking out]

[inhaling again]

[buzzing like deflating balloon]

Get off him, Patrick!

What are you worried about?

He looks better already.

But he still feels cold.

Well, let's go put him
in the warm.

Do you think he'll be okay?

You know, you worry too much.

The Patrick is here
and SpongeBob,

I know a lot about
head injuries, believe...

[snaps fingers]

Me.

Hey, what's that on your shoe?

I don't know.

It kind of looks like...

Squidward!
Squidward!

[both yelling]

Get him off me!
Go away, go away!

[humming contentedly
as music continues playing]

No, no, that part goes here.

Oh, yeah...

Yeah, ththat's it, uhhuh.

We're almost there.

We can do this.
It's working.

Yeah, this is working.
This is working.

It's working.

Patrick, this isn't working!

Look!

I don't know how to say it
but our old pal Squidward,

he's... he's...

he's pushing up daisies.

Oh, I thought he was dead.

[door squeaks]

[yells]

[screams]

What are you doing here?!

[teeth chattering]
No!...

No! No!

Well, are you two
going to say something

or do I have to...

No, stay back!

What is the matter
with you two?

Don't! Don't hurt us!

[sobbing]
It was an accident.

What are you two talking about?

[splat]

[screams] Uh...

Look what you've done to me!

Oh, when I get my hands on you,
I'll...

Please, Mr. Squidward ghost.

Spare us your ghostly anger!

[kissing]

Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost!

Please don't haunt us.

We'll do anything you want.

Just have mercy on us!

Enough.

Listen up!

Squidward's ghost

is feeling unusually
generous today.

He hath decided
to spare ye a horrible fate.

[hissing]

All ye must do is tend
to my every whim

and tickle my fancy on demand.

Does that include...
Quiet!

Now, do as you're told lest ye

incur the wrath of Squidward!

I think they make a cream
for that now.

[panting and groaning]

Uh... Here?

Too hot.

[huffing and puffing]

Here?

No, too wet.

Keep going. Keep going.

Here?

Too loose, Lautrec.

[rim shot]

Too tired...

Perfect.

Hmm, I feel...

needy.

Slaves,
fetcheth me some nourishment.

Only the freshest,
o spooky one.

A grape fresh from the vine,
your ghostliness.

Mmm, mmm, mmm!

A banana peeled to your liking
your incorporialness.

Mmm...

[gulps]
One watermelon...

D'oh!

Fresh from the manure field
your spookiness.

Art thou not pleased?

[spitting, sputtering]

Enough of that!

I want something else
to eat now.

Something
that's very difficult to find.

What do you hunger for, master?

Whatever you want,
we'll find it.

We'll find it!

Cherry pie.

Where'd you get that?

I found it.
Well, go find it again!

SpongeBob, get over here.

Now spin around.

That's better.

Now jog in place.

Say "flank steak."

Flank steak.

I think
I'm beginning to like this.

Stop.
[feet squeal]

Now play me
an elaborate song with this!

But this
is just a piece of tissue paper.

Oh, my!

Always have to have it our way,
don't we?

Oh, boohoo.

[tries to play song]

I can't do it!

Well, I hope you don't have
any plans tonight

because
you're not allowed to leave

that spot till I hear a song.

[crickets chirping]

[rooster crows]

What's this?

Napping on the job?

You're supposed to be
making music for me.

As punishment

for this insolence Squidward's
ghost commandeth you

to clean out his back room.

I found it.

I'll take that.

Yes, your ghostliness.

This is fun.

Patrick,
are you ready for this?

Yes.

Okay, let's go.

Patrick, are you coming?
Yes.

Patrick, it's this way.

Where?
Here.

Oh! Coming!

How are we going to clean up
all this mess?

It's easy.

Just tear this wallpaper off.

[guffaws]

Oh, look, you missed some.

Oh, let's see.

It's a comic book,
and look at this

It's the origin
of the flying Dutchman.

It says when he died
they used his body

as a window display.

Now he haunts the seven seas

because
he was never put to rest.

Well, don't you get it, Patrick?

We're going to go shopping?

No!

We're going to put
poor old Squidward to rest.

Ow!

What the heck was that?

Initiation.

[giggles]

That was part
one of your ceremony.

Ceremony for what?

We're going to put you to rest.

I don't want to be put to rest!

All I want
are those chores done.

Now, did you clean
the back room yet?

Yeah.
Oh, really?

I'm going to go check.

[screams]

Okay, get in.

Are you crazy?
I'm not getting in.

But you said
we could put you to rest.

I didn't say
anything like that.

Now, get out of my house!

Okay.

[door closes]

[sighs]

Now what?

I wrote "Here lies Squidward.

You may not remember him,
but..."

[screams]

Oh, hi, Squidward.

Does this look deep enough?

SpongeBob, cut that out!

Oh, look,
the mourners have arrived.

Oh, Squidward,
we all came as soon

as we were sure you were dead.

SpongeBob, are you trying
to put me in the nuthouse?

No, just into this hole.

[groaning]

[sighs]

SpongeBob,
I have a confession to make.

[squeals]

You're bald?
No, I'm not bald!

I'm alive!

Now, get rid of that tombstone

and tell all your friends
to go home.

But...
Do it.

Go home.
[all grumbling]

But I...

Master...
I'm not your master.

I'm your neighbor.

Now, do me a favor
and stop doing me favors!

As you wish, master.

D'oh!

Boy, he really had us fooled.

No, Patrick, he's the fool.

He's a ghost in denial.

He needs us now more than ever.

You're right.

He really needs to get up
to the great beyond.

Patrick, say that again.

That again.

No, the other thing.
No, the other thing.

No, what you said
before when...

No, what you said
before when...

Never mind!

I've got an idea.

Never mind, I've got an idea.

[somebody exhaling]

I can't reach him.

Blow harder.

[SpongeBob exhaling again]

There he goes!

[sniffles]
Isn't he beautiful?

How high's he going to go?

All the way, Patrick,
up to the great beyond.

[sniffles]

Goodbye, friend.

Happy trails!

[yelling angrily]

You're welcome!

You're welcome!

He's on the other side now.

Yeah.

He's in a better place.
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives
in a pineapple under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent
and yellow and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[sniffs]

Ah...

[door opens]
[Pearl crying]

Don't cry, love.

Daddy's going
to make it all right.

Calm down, girl!
[crying louder]

Ah...
[screams]

Mr. Krabs,
what's wrong with Pearl?

Her scurvy prom date
stood her up,

boy and now she can't
seem to find another.

That's because
there's only one fish

in the sea as long,
tan, and handsome as he is...

And that's him!

No, no, baby.

No more crying.

We'll get you a date.

Why, uh...

I'll take you.

[starting to cry]

What about Squidward?

[starting to cry]

Wait, wait...

Here, take SpongeBob.

Ah! The fry cook?

Do you know what that
would do to my complexion?

People will mistake me
for a planetarium.

What do you mean?

I don't know...

But I can't take him, daddy.

They'll kick me off
the most frequently pictured

in the yearbook committee.

Yeah, they would.

We've got to find someone else.

Listen up!

Which one of you lucky lubbers

wants to take me
lovely daughter pearl

to the prom?

Just don't be late, SpongeBob.

Now listen, boy,
I'm acounting on you

to make
this a very special night

for a very special girl.

Remember, you're doing it
for good old Mr...

Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.

Are you talking
to that dummy I made?

It's pretty realistic, isn't it?

I made this part out of...
Never mind that, boy!

You're taking Pearl to her prom.

Really? Oh, wow!

Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.

I am a prom expert.

Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure.

I couldn't even get a date
for my own junior prom.

[meows]

No, that was Patrick
who brought his mom.

Besides, how am I supposed
to compare with Pearl's

old boyfriend,
Mr. Long, tan and handsome?

[meows]

What is it, Gary?
What do you have?

[honking and beeping]

Say, Gary...

This magazine gives me an idea.

Long...

Tan...

Mmm...

Handsome.

[boinging]

Okay, Gary, wait till Pearl
gets an eyeful of this!

[boinging]

[doorbell rings]

Hello?

What do you think, Pearl?

Cleans up pretty good,
doesn't he?

Well, at least
no one will recognize you.

Now, listen, SpongeBob,
I just want to get

through this dance
with my social status intact.

I want to go to the prom,
get my picture taken,

and I want to dance, okay?

I wanna drink punch
with my friends...

And don't do that other thing
you're always doing...

Uh, Pearl,
we got to get back to the limo.

A limo!

Why didn't you say so?

I love limousines!

Go easy on him, lassie!

I can't afford to break
in a new fry cook!

Harharhar...

[rock music playing]

[metal scraping harshly]

Ow... Ow... Ow...

[general conversation]

The gym looks wonderful.

Well, I guess the first thing
we should do is...

[camera clicks]

Yay, my first prom picture!

Uh...

Our first prom picture.

Let's get this over with.

Come on, SpongeBob.

Be right there!
[boinging]

Will you hurry up?

Uh... Just a second!

[boinging]
Coming...

Sorry...
[boinging]

Here I am...

Cheese...

Oh!

That will be a keeper.

Look, it's Pearl!

Hi, Pearl!

SpongeBob,
here come my friends!

Uh... Go get me some punch!

Prom expert, away!

[boinging]

Hi, Pearl!

Hi, girls.

I'd like you
to meet Billy Fishkins.

Meep.

And you know Bryan Flounder
from math class.

Meep.
Hi, Bryan.

So...

Like, where's your date, Pearl?

We're dying to meet him.

He's over at the punch bowl
getting me some punch.

Ooh, is he the really tall one?

Oh, yes.

I mean, oh, no...

Ah... Eee...

Eee...

Ah...

Eee...

Ah...

Eee...

Ah...

[boinging]

Huphuphup...

Huphuphuphup...

Huphuphup...

Whoa... Oh!

Oh...

Oh, quick, let's go see
how ugly Cindy's dress is.

Thank you. Meep.

Yeah, thanks.

SpongeBob,
what are you doing?!

Hi, Pearl!

Come on, it won't bite.

You look ridiculous!

[gasps]

What is it?

Get down, they'll see us!

It's my exboyfriend,
Octavius Rex,

a.k.a. Long, tan and handsome.

Meep.

Whoa...

But I bet he isn't holder

of the regional romantic dance
championship trophy.

Give me that back.

[laughs]

That didn't just happen.

Let's go!

[rock music playing]

Ready?

SpongeBob, what are you doing?

Can't you see everybody here
is doing the whack?

[whacking]

The whack?

Oh, yeah, I invented that one.

Uh...
[boinging]

Are you sure you can do this?

Oh...

[screams]

[screaming]

[crashing]

[clattering]

Well, I guess
you can take me home now.

Now that
you've ruined everything...

[crying]

Don't cry,
the prom expert is here.

I haven't failed yet.

Hey, we can still...

No, I broke that.

I know! We could...

No.

Don't cry, don't cry.

Whatever you do, don't...

[crying]

Wow, what did you do to him?

Poor little guy.

[crying]

[screaming]

Sponge, are you okay?

[crying]

Ruined everything. Oh...

Don't worry, SpongeBob
You didn't mess everything up.

[wailing incoherently]

Hot dog.

[laughs]

Actually, it was pretty funny

when that hot dog landed
in Judy's hair.

[wailing]

Good time.

But I am having a good time.

You know, we haven't finished
our dance yet.

[mumbling question]

Yes,
you can still wear the wig.

Let's go!

All right, you invertebrates.

I'm going to teach you
how to do the sponge.

Well, if you take your leg
and you stick it in the air

And then
you take the other one

And jam it right up there

You twist yourself around
and give a great big lunge

Now you're doing the sponge

Huh,
do the sponge, sponge

Oh, do the sponge

Bet your buns
you're doing the sponge

Well, now,
first you take your leg

And you stick it in the air

And then
you take the other one

Oh, oh, oh...

And you jam it
right up there...

Meep, meep.

Get lost, pizza topping.

Can't you see
I'm doing the sponge?

A big lunge

Now you're doing,

Yeah, now you're doing
the sponge

All right now,
yeah, do the sponge, sponge

[screaming]

Oh, do the sponge

Before you know,
you're taking the plunge

I said the sponge, sponge,
oh, do the sponge

[siren wailing]

Bet your buns
you're doing the sponge

Yeah, bet your buns
you're doing the sponge

Oh, yeah,
well, you're doing the sponge

Oh, I said the sponge, sponge,
yeah, do the sponge

[whooping]

Yeah, do the sponge, sponge

They love us!

Yay, we're popular!

[crowd grumbling]

Go wreck someone else's prom,
will you?

Gee whiz, Pearl.

I'm sorry tonight

didn't turn out
like you planned.

Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob.

I knew it would be
a total disaster all along.

But as far as disasters go,
that was really fun.

Aha!

Keep away
from my precious little flower!

[gasps]

You almost stepped on it.

Oh, daddy!

Well, goodnight, short,
yellow and spongy.

SpongeBob?

Good job, laddie.

Oh, there you are, dummy.

You sure come in handy.

[laughing]

Hey, Squidward.

Hey, Squidward.

Hey, Squidward.

Hey, Squidward.

Hey, Squidward.
Okay, I'll bite.

What is it, SpongeBob?

Do you know what today is?

Annoy Squidward day?

[SpongeBob laughs] No, silly.

That's on the 15th.

Today's the beginning
of the judging

for employee of the month.

SpongeBob, don't you know
that award is a scam?

What do you mean?

Mr. Krabs gives you that award

so you'll work harder
for no extra money.

That is not true, Squidward.

He gives it to me
because I work harder.

You could win it, too,
if you tried harder.

Oh, for what?

To get my face on
the wall of shame?

Squidward,
you've got it all wrong.

Having pride in your work
is nothing to be ashamed of.

Why, it's the only thing
that makes it all worthwhile.

Thattaboy, SpongeBob.

This is going to be
a tough one, though.

There's no clearcut winner.

Watch out, SpongeBob

Squidward appears to be
on the verge of a breakout.

There might be a new face
on the wall this month.

Huh?

That's right, SpongeBob.

I might sneak up on you.

[laughing]
[laughing]

[laughing]

No!

[sobbing]

How could I have

let the quality
of my work slip so much?

[laughing]

[grunting]

[screams]

[grunting]

Need some help?

[screams]

What are you doing?

Making Krabby Patties?

You're losing it.

Don't you know
that award is a load of...

garbage.

Please,
don't tell Mr. Krabs about this.

It'll hurt my chances
of winning the award.

I already told you,
that award is a bunch of...

baloney.

That is not true, Squidward.

Like this hat,
the award is a symbol of...

It's a symbol
that you're a chump.

[screams] No, Squidward.

Oh!

And this is a symbol
of what I think

of the employee
of the month award!

[clang] Ow!

An experienced
employee of the month

always keeps a brick of lead
in his hat.

I'm telling you
for the last time,

that award
is nothing but a joke.

What if Squidward's right?

What if the award is a phony?

Does this mean my whole body
of work is meaningless?

Stow that kind of talk, sailor.

This is war now, private.

That's exactly
what he wants you to think.

This is no time
to go lilylivered on us.

But, sir...

There's no room
for "buts" in war, soldier.

He wants you to crack.

He's trying to trick you,
get inside your mind.

You must stop at nothing
and I mean nothing

to defeat him.

Have I made myself clear,
private?

Crystal, sir.

Good. Now move out!

I won't let Squidward win.

He can't go to work
if he doesn't wake up.

Target sighted.

Huh?

[Squidward gargling]

Huh?

[muttering]
[giggles]

[screaming]

SpongeBob!

What are you doing here?

You can't win that award
if you don't get up for work.

Huh?
Haha.

[grunting]

[grunting]

Stop it, SpongeBob.

If I really wanted that award,

I could win it
with my tentacles tied.

That can be arranged.

You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!

Maybe so, but I did
win employee of the month

26 months in a row.

Are y...

Are you trying to say
that you are better than me?

I've been better than you
for 26 months

and it'll be 27 tomorrow.

Oh, that's it,
squareforbrains, that's it!

I'm going to show you

how easy it
is to win that award.

I'm going to be
the new employee of the month.

I will prove to you I am far
more competent than you.

Well, I'm going in early
to wax the floors.

Don't bother,
I'll have done it already

by the time you get there.

Well, you'll have to get up

pretty early
to get there before me.

I don't need the sleep...

Loser.

Well, me neither...

26time loser.

Look at him, watching me.

I'm watching you, SpongeBob.

You're not leaving before me.

Hey, Squidward,
getting sleepy, huh?

No.

How about you?

Nope.

[playing lullaby]

Nightynight.

[snoring]

[chuckling]

[screams]

SpongeBob!

Hey, Squidward.

Going somewhere?

I'm going to wring you dry
when I get out of here.

Now get me out of here.

Okay, Squidward.

I'll stop by after work.

SpongeBob...

SpongeBob!

Now to get some rest.

Don't want to look tired

for my employee
of the month photo.

[snoring]

[grunting]

[hammering]
Squidward!

That ought to hold him.

[sawing]

[laughs]

[chuckling]

Huh?

Oh...

SpongeBob! Why, you little...

Oh...
[laughing]

Hmm... A Krabby Patty.

[sniffing]

Ow! [stifled] Squidward!

So long, sponge loser.

[yells]
[laughs]

[Squidward laughs]

[SpongeBob laughs]

[Squidward laughs]

[both grunting and straining]

SpongeBob...

Truce.

Truce.

SpongeBob,
I can't take it anymore.

If we keep this up,

neither of us
will win the award.

You're right.

We should
save our energy for work

where we really need it.

Okay, let's have
a good, clean fight.

And may the better man win.

[thinking] He's nothing
but a lying, boneless,

inksquirting, bignosed phony.

Look at that bucktoothed,
cornfed smile.

You can't trust him
as far as you can throw him.

As soon
as he stops shaking my hand...

I'm going to make
a run for it.

[both laugh nervously]

[gasping and panting]

Money, money,
going to make some money...

[squishing and squirting]

[gasping and panting]

Ah, it warms me wallet
to see me

employees coming in so early.

[gasping and panting]

Boys, you're early.

[gasping and panting]

Wait...

[crashing and clattering]

Look, Mr. Krabs, clean floors!

Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!

Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!

What's going on here?

It's more efficient

to clean dishes
this way, Mr. Krabs.

No!

Flowers and chocolates
for you, Mr. Krabs!

Look, I'm putting my own money
into the register, Mr. Krabs!

Two spatulas to increase
productivity, Mr. Krabs!

Faster, SpongeBob, faster.

There's nothing to this patty
flipping, Mr. Krabs.

I'll easily double your output,
sponge cog!

Boys, boys, boys!

Wha...

Help! Help!

Hey, free Krabby Patties!

Hey, look at that,
Krabby Patties!

Wait, you've got to pay
for those.

Wait! Wait!

Wait!

sBoys, the Krabby Patties!

So who's the winner
of employee of the month?

Me, me, me...
Me, me, me...

Wait!

Boys, the Krabby Patties!

Boys, wait...
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish.

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[with French accent]
Halloween is no different

under the wavespirates,
skeletons and sea monsters...

[laughing evilly]

Oop, sorry.

Everyone having fun.

Well, almost everyone.

Huh?
[thump]

[hinge creaks eerily]

Who's there?

[creaking]

[whimpering nervously]

Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes
are doneI'm leaving.

Hold on.

Don't you want to hear
my annual scary story?

No, thank you, Mr. Krabs.

Uh, does it have monsters in it?

Aye

The worst monster of them all.

Uh...

No.

Is it a true story?

True as the deep blue.

Okay, maybe just a little.

Have a seat, me boy.

Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot!

Every year, on Halloween night

the flying Dutchman

descends on bikini bottom
in a pirate ship...

just like this, only bigger.

Excuse me.

Did his ship look
like a krabby patty?

Like I was saying,
the flying Dutchman swoops down

and starts
stealing people's souls.

Do souls look like pickles?

Aye, as a matter of fact,
they do.

Then he puts them
where you can never get them

in his soul bag.

[laughing evilly]

I've come for your pickle.

[screams]
Ha!

Scaredypants gets easier
to scare every year!

[both laugh heartily]
Hmm...

Squidward.

Nothing
like a good ghost story,

eh, me boy?

Hope you're not too scared

to come to me party tonight
SpongeBob scaredypants.

[laughing]

Steal your soul.
[screams]

[evil laughter]

[gasps]

Trick or treat.
[SpongeBob yells]

It's okay, son.

That's just SpongeBob
scaredypants.

[honks]
[screams]

[teeth chattering]

Happy Halloween, scaredypants.

[cackles]

The name's SquarePants.

It's SquarePants!

I don't get it, Gary.

Every Halloween,
no matter how hard I try,

everybody scares me.

[Gary meows]

Well, I'm sick of it.

No more scaredypants.

[screams]

[knees clattering]

[knocking at door]
SpongeBob!

Gary, it's Patrick.

I'm going to scare him.

It's my turn.

Rar!

Hiya, SpongeBob.

[scream, crunch]

Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

Why can't I be
frightening for once?

Where's my chance?

If you want to be scary

you're going
to need a good costume.

What do you think?
Great!

You're going
as my trickortreat bag.

No, no!

I'm the ghost
of the flying Dutchman.

Uh, something's missing.

I know!

[handsawing]

[powersawing]

Step into these babies, Hans.

Terrifying.

I don't know, Patrick.

[kids giggle]
[doorbell rings]

Come on, SpongeBob,
it's little kids!

Little kids are easy to scare.

Trick or treat!

Rar, rar!

[laughing]

Look,
it's the haunted mattress.

Okay, okay
Here's your candy.

No, please.

That was enough of a treat.

Thank you.

[kids laughing]

I don't get it, Patrick.

SpongeBob,
look at my new paper ghost.

Ooh!

Scary.

That is it, Patrick.

What's it?

What's the difference
between that ghost and me?

Uh...

No, no, no, wait, don't tell me.

[Patrick groaning with exertion]

Dddon't tell me.

Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

I can do this!

I can do this, don't tell me,

don't tell me!
Don't tell me!

Okay, tell me.

I've got a square head

and a real ghost
has a round one.

All we have to do is make
my head round andboo!

I'm scary.

Okay, are you ready?

Remember, like this.

You sure you want to do this?

Shave me down, make me round.

All right.

Let's get to it.

[shaver buzzing]

What do you think?
Perfect.

Now, that's scary!

Let's go scare somebody.

Whoo...

I'm the flying Dutchman!

Ooh...

I don't know who I am!

[doorbell rings]

Rar, rar!

I'm the flying Dutchman.

Ooh...

I'm the flying Dutchman's
best friend.

[both laughing]

Hey,
don't you kids want your candy?

[both laughing]

Oh, boy, that was something.

Your costume really packs
a punch.

Do you think?

Oh, no question.

You scared
the barnacles off that guy.

Who should we scare next?

There's a whole party
just full of people down

at the Krusty Krab
and the flying Dutchman

is going to show up uninvited.

[people laughing outside]

Ooh, here comes someone now.

Rar!

Whoo...

I'm the flying Dutchman!

[laughing]

Wasn't
that the haunted mattress?

I guess he's been demoted
to a haunted sleeping bag.

[laughing]

[party music playing]

[general conversation]

[choking and coughing]

Oh, dad,
you're embarrassing me again.

[crying]

[gagging, gasping]

[spurt]

[whistle]

[glass shatters]

Howdy, Squidward...

I mean flying Dutchman.

Great party, huh?

What are you supposed to be?

Why,
I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl.

I don't get it.

[slurping]

Are you ready, SpongeBob?

Okay, Patrick.

Kill the lights.

[music stops]
[people screaming]

[Patrick laughing evilly]

I am the flying Dutchman!

Booga, booga, booga, booga!

[rattling]

Give me your souls!

[buzzing]

[zap]

Huh?

[Patrick yelling]

[SpongeBob screaming]

[yelling]

Whoa!

[yelling]

[yelling and screaming]

Ooh! Aah!

Ouch!
[SpongeBob yells]

[yelling repeatedly]

[yelling slows to halt]

Hey, that's no Dutchman.

That's SpongeBob!

SpongeBob?
SpongeBob.

[all laughing]

Help!

Help!

I am not SpongeBob!

Those are my street clothes.

[partygoers laughing]

Flying Dutchman?!

Flying Dopeman!

[thunder]

Enough!

[all gasp]

[laughing evilly]

It's the real flying Dutchman!

[gasps]

You bet your lily white livers
I'm the Flying Dutchman.

And I'll let you
in on a little secret.

I'm going to steal your soul!

[screaming]

Quiet!

You had it coming,
you big crybabies.

Every year,
people dressing like me!

[whistling nonchalantly]

Turning
the Flying Dutchman name

into a laughingstock!

But that's not the reason
I'm taking your souls.

No, this is the straw
that broke the camel's back.

Out of all the Dutchman costumes
I've seen,

yours is the most insulting.

Do you mean I'm not scary?

You?!

Scary?

[laughing thunderously]

Let me tell you about scary,
kid.

There's all kinds
of scary things in the world.

Spiders are scary.

I'm scary.

You?

You're not scary.

Okay, let's get this over with.

[laughing evilly]

[screaming]

SpongeBob!

First I got to get rid
of this stupid costume.

[yelling]

Hey, what do you know!

I scared him!

[laughing]

[all screaming]

It worked, Patrick.

I scared everybody.

Yeah.

I guess it was your pink hat.

Pink hat?

Oh, that's not a hat.

That's my brain.

Oh...

[screaming]

Don't worry. It grows back.

Exercise time is over, Gary.

We don't want you
getting too thin.

Here, boy.

Fetch!

[rooster crows]

[snoring]

[meows]

Huh?

Good job, Gary.

I love you, Gary.

Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary...

Gary, Gary, Gary.

[laughing]

Down, boy!

[laughing]

SpongeBob!

Are you ready?

Are you ready?

Are you ready?

For what?

The annual jellyfish convention
in Ukulele bottom this weekend.

Ha... ya!

[yelling]

[glass shatters]

So you ready or what?

That was this weekend?

I can't go.

I don't have anyone
to take care of Gary.

Would you please stop leaving
your undergarments

on my front lawn?

Squidward, could you watch
Gary this weekend?

What's a Gary?

Not a GaryGary.

He's my pet snail.

[pop]

Say "Hello."

[hisses]

Aah!

You actually care
for that thing?

I love Gary!

Well, I don't.

Get somebody else.

I guess we can't go away
this weekend after all, Patrick.

Go away?

You mean, if I watch Gary,

you guys will be gone
all weekend?

Actually, a threeday weekend.

As in "Not here
for three days"?

Yeah, but you've already said
you can't do it.

We understand.

Don't feel bad, Squidward.

The three of us can still have

our own jellyfish convention
at your house.

I changed my mind.

You guys deserve a weekend away.

You'll do it?

Great!

Let me show you
a little bit about snail care.

You need to take Gary
for a walk twice a day...

Friday, Saturday and Sunday

a threeday weekend.

Let me show you
how to feed him.

I have all the cans marked.

A can in the morning
and a can at night.

[sarcastically]
Sure it's enough?

Jellyfishing, jellyfishing,
jellyfishing, jellyfishing!

The bus is here!

The bus is here!

Come on, SpongeBob!

Jellyfishing!

Jellyfishing!

Well, time to go.

Don't want to be late. Byebye.

Now you won't forget
my instructions, will you?

I have the memory
of an elephant.

I'll take good care of Fred.

Gary.
Right, yeah, right.

Jellyfishing!
Jellyfishing!

Jellyfishing!

So long, losers!

[laughs]

They're gone.

[laughs]

[meows]

[humming]

This is going to be
the best three days of my life.

[sighs]

I'm going to do all the things

I can't normally do
because of SpongeBob.

[sizzling quietly]

Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!

Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!

Well, thus ends
the greatest weekend of my life.

No SpongeBob, no Patrick,

nothing but me, me, me.

[groans gutturally]

[thud]

[screams] The snail!

I forgot the snail!

[panting]

[moans]

I've got to do something.

Oh!

Okay, okay, okay.

Here we go,
here we go, right here.

Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!

You've got to finish this food!

See you later, Patrick.

Come on, eat!

Eat! Eat!

Oh!

Gary, I'm home!

Hi, SpongeBob.

Squidward,
what are you doing here?

[gulps hard]

Aah!

Just, uh,
checking up on old Gary for you.

What a great friend
you are, Squidward.

So...

Well, I guess
I'll see you later. Bye.

Thanks, Squidward.

I can always count on you.

[wheezes]

[screams]

Ah!

Gary!

Gary, what's happened to you?

What's wrong?

Squidward,
something's wrong with Gary!

Squidward!

Oh!

Yes, yes,
it's just as I thought.

What?

This is definitely a snail.

[gasps] I knew it!

Oh, Squid, did you hear that?

Therefore,
a shot of snail plasma

must be carefully administered.

Here you go.

You're gonna do it?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm too squeamish.

Uh, hang on, doc.

Let me help you
with your bag there.

Squid, wait.

I can't give Gary his plasma.

I'm squeamish, too.

Oh, SpongeBob,
I don't want to...

[violent coughing]

Gary!

Okay, okay, I'll do it.

Now, don't hurt him, Squidward.

Okay, steady.

Wait, that's too hard.

Okay, okay, okay, okay,
try it again.

Wait!

Wait. Wait. Wait.

[stammers] Hold him still.

Wait. Wait. Wait.

You hold him still!
Wait.

Ouch! Uh, Squidward...

you've injected me
with snail plasma.

Well, you made me do it.

What's going to happen to me?

Oh, nothing,
it's just a little snail plasma.

I don't know,
I feel kind of funny.

I'm telling you
it's all in your head!

[moans]

[gulps]

[gargles, then clears throat]

[meows spiritedly]

He just needed water?

Oh, Gary, you're better!

Oh, how touching.

I'm going to go home
and throw up.

Good night.

Squidward, wait!
The snail plasma.

Trust me, SpongeBob.

Nothing's going
to happen to you.

You're fine.

[meows]

Don't worry, Gary.

Squidward says I'll be fine.

He knows everything.

So, you hungry?

[meows loudly]

Hmm?

Hmm!

Mmm.

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Here you go.

Eat up, Gary.

[meows questioningly]

Sorry, Gary,
I couldn't control myself.

[burps] Meow.

Why'd I just do that?

Am I cracking up?

[meows]

No.

No, Squidward's right.

I'm fine.

I worry too much.

It's all in my head.

I feel tiptop.

Gary,
you're getting a lot faster.

[footsteps thumping loudly]

[voice echoes]
Look at me.

Never better. [yelps]

I'm okay.
Squidward said I'm fine.

[screams]

[shrieks]

Gary!

I'm fine!

You see?

[grunting]

That's okay,
I'm a lefty, anyway.

[grunts, screams]

Now I don't have
to buy those new shoes.

[screams and groans]

I take it back, Gary.

Something is wrong with me!

Ow.

I hope I never see
another snail again.

Good night, Clari.

[doorbell rings, knock on door]

Who could that be?

As if I didn't already know.

SpongeBob, I already told you,

you're going to be just fi...

[screams]

Ow.

Meow, meow.

[screams]

Meow, meow.

[panting]

SpongeBob?

Oh, Neptune, what have I done?

It's all your fault.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Get it together, Squidward.

Meow!

[screams]

Meow! Meow, meow.

Meow.
[gasps]

Meow.

Meow, meow.

[screaming]

None of this would be happening
if I'd only fed that snail.

Yeah!

Well...

Under the sea?

SpongeBob scaredypants!

Absorbent and yellow
and spooky is he.

SpongeBob scaredypants!

If nautical chills be
something you wish...

SpongeBob scaredypants!

Then scream your gills out
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob scaredypants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

SB129.

Ah, it is Sunday morning
in Bikini Bottom,

and it is about time
for Squidward

to practice his clarinet.

So get your earplugs ready.

Mmm...
[smacks loudly]

I think
I'll treat Bikini Bottom

to some real music.

[snoring]

[Gary meows]

[blasting]
Ow!

[horn continues blowing]

Good morning, Squidward!

Want to go jellyfishing?

[squeaking]

Hooray!

We'll be right over.

[squeaking]

[grumbling]

[knock at door]

I wonder who that could be.

Ready to go?

No, I'm not ready to go!

He doesn't want
to play with us.

No, Patrick,
he's just not ready.

[knock at door]

Ready now?
No!

[knock at door]
[grumbling]

How about now?
No!

[knock]
Huh?

Now?
No!

[knock] Now?

No!
How about now?

No! No!
Now? Now?

No! No!
Now? Now?

No! No!

What?
Ready yet?

No, I'm not ready!
I'll never be ready.

Don't you get it?

Sure, we do.
What?

[mumbling]

Ready?

[smack]

Out!

Jeesh! Shouldn't you be
at work today, SpongeBob?

I'd love to be at work today.

But it's Sunday.

The Krusty Krab is closed.

Hold on a second.

I'll be right out.

Hello?

[silence]
Ah!

Alone at last!

[inhales deeply]

Squidward!

Squidward!

Squidward!

[wind howling]

Squidward!

Oh, Squidward!
Squidward?

Squidward?
Squidward?

Well, he's not here.

And I'll bet
that eager beaver's

already down
at jellyfish fields.

Aha!

They're finally gone.

What the...? Locked?

Oh, no!

Oh, well,
someone will realize I'm gone

and come looking for me.

I'll be out of here in no time.

2,000 years later.

[computer beeping]

Holy Krabby Patties!

A frozen cephalopod.

[zapping]

[screaming]

I'll be out of here
in no time.

Greetings, primitive.

SpongeBob?

Is that you?

SpongeBob?

No!

[Mechanized voice]
I am Spongetron.

Welcome to the future.

What?

Welcome to the future.

Uh...

The future?

Huh?

[electronic pulsing]

Okay, what's going on here?

Why is everything chrome?

Everything is chrome
in the future.

Wha... Uh... Uh...

Oh, my!

Impossible!

He's lying!

[squeaking]

[tires squeal]

He's right!

Of course I'm right,
Squidward.

Just ask my clones
Spongetrons X, Y and Z.

Are the...

Other letters of the alphabet
involved here?

Sureall 486 of them.

Future!

Future!

Future!

Future!

Thanks.

Now, listen, all of you!

I don't belong here.

This is all a horrible mistake.

Please,
we've got to do something!

Jellyfishing!

[loud static]

Did somebody say
"jellyfishing"?

Hi, Pattron!

Jjust listen to me.

I'm not supposed to be here.

I've got to get home
to my own time period.

I got to go!

Well, why didn't you just ask?

The time machine
is down the hall, to the left.

[laughing gleefully]

[machine humming loudly]

Oops!

Oh, yeah,
that one's the can opener.

But try the one on the right.

Well, I wouldn't have
chosen this interior.

Oh, what's this?

Well, if SpongeBob
exists in the future

I'd better go to the past.

[siren beeping]

Wow!

Primitive.

Has sort of an oldworld charm.

Whoa!

I guess this is before manners
were invented!

Well, at least there's no sign
of Spongebrat.

Maybe now I can finally
be alone with my clarinet.

[rustling nearby]

[bang]

[whoosh]
Huh?

What?

Huh?

[screams]

[chomping]

SpongeBob?

[yells]

Stay back!

[sniffing]

Uh, no thanks.

[heavy breathing nearby]

Uh...

Hi there.

Well, I better be going now.

[hooting like monkey]

Yes, that's my arm.

Oh, that's sweet.

[bellowing]

What, is it time
for your flea bath now?

[bones rattling]

Oh,
it's just a little jellyfish.

[yelling frantically]

[hooting in alarm]

Well, I'm going away now.

Ah!

Here's a nice, shady spot,
away from those fools.

[inhales deeply]

[SpongeBob hooting]
[Patrick bellowing]

[SpongeBob screaming]

[zap]

[howling]

[zap]

[yelling]

What are you simpletons doing?

You're supposed
to catch these things

Not torture yourself with them.

Give me those loincloths!

I can't believe it.

[mumbling]

This ought to make things
go a little smoother.

[whimpering]

Give me those things!

You're supposed
to catch themlike this.

It's called jellyfishing.

[both grunting stupidly]

Ah, finally!

[inhales deeply]

[playing squeaky tune]

[yelling angrily]

[screams]

Get me out of here.

Uhoh.

Loser.

[bellowing wildly]

[electronic whirring]

[alarm beeping]

[electronic zap]

[voice echoing eerily]

[squeaking]

He's not here.

No more SpongeBob.

No more!

I may finally have found
a place where I can be all...

Alone!

[various voices]

Alone...

Alone...

Alone...

[voices echoing]

I got to get out of here!

[panting]

[voices echoing eerily]

Where's the time machine?

Where's anything?

Where, where, where, where...!

I want to go home.

I want to go home.
I want to go home.

I want to go home.

I miss Bikini Bottom.

I miss my Easter island head.

I even miss SpongeBob.

SpongeBob! Patrick!

Hi, Squidward.

Oh, I'm back!

I can't believe this.

I was in space,
and I went to the future,

and then I went to the past,
and then I was nowhere.

But now I'm back

and you don't know
how happy I am to see you guys.

Does this mean
you want to go...

jellyfishing?

No!

D'oh!

Who's the barnaclehead
who invented that game, anyway?

You are, Squidward.

[Patrick
and SpongeBob laughing]

I'm going back.

[whacks]

[yells]
Kiai!

Oh, sorry, pineapple house.

I thought
you were someone else.

Ah!

What a great day at work.

[clattering nearby]

Yeah!

[footsteps quacking]

[groaning]

I know you're back there,
Sandy.

And I also know that nobody
can hide from Sponge...

Bob.

I got you now!

Kiai!

Well,
I guess the coast is clear.

Yeah, shopping's weird.

Did you ever go
into the seafood aisle

and say, "Who eats this stuff?"

[laughing]

I love this show!
Me, too.

[screams]

[karate yelling]

Uh, just a second.

Safety first.

And now, spin technique.

[yelling]

[yells]

Double overhand squirrel knot.

[bowling ball rumbling]
[striking pins]

I'm going to get you tomorrow,
SpongeBob.

That'll be the day.

Whoop, whoop, whoop,
whoop, whoop, whoop...

[humming to herself]

[phone cuckooing]

Hello.
Kiai!

Kiai! Kiai!

Nice try, Spongebrain.

[yells]

Hey, Sandy,
have you ever heard

the one about the squirrel
and the tin cans?

Uh, don't think so.

Well, it goes like this.

Oh, wait,
I forgot the punch line.

[screeches]

Oh, yeah.

[laughing]

That's a good one, isn't it?

What a beautiful day.

Beautiful sky,
beautiful plants.

Hi, plants.

Beautiful...

Pile of cans.

Mmmmmm.

Sandy, that is your
worst disguise yet.

No, it's not, SpongeBob.

This is.

Now, prepare for a long,
merciless whooping.

Mmm, mmm.

My favorite.

[laughing evilly]

By the powers of naughtiness,

I command this particular drop
of hot sauce

to be really, really hot!

Sandy, wait!

Victory is yours.

I knew you'd come
to your senses, SpongeBob.

Whoa!

Kiai!

Curses...!

Oh, what is going on?

With an extra cheese, to go.

Three patties,
four large oyster skins

on the double, SpongeBob.

Oh, yeah.

Got you!

SpongeBob...

I'm going to pretend
that didn't happen.

Now fill these orders
or leave, SpongeBob.

We're very busy today.

Order... Oh!

[fly buzzing]

Ah...

SpongeBob, now,
are you going to...

Oh, Squidward, I was going
through some records

back in me office, and...

Huh? So you got
the hairpiece after all.

[SpongeBob yelling]

Thought you could sneak up
on me at work, did you?

Well, you can't
'cause I'm fast,

I'm mean, and I can do this.

Sss!

Took care of her, yes, I did.
Oh!

Ahoy, sir.

What was that?

But sir, she snuck up on me.

In my own dojo.

Are you on some
new allergy medication, boy?

No, sir, just practicing
my karate, sir

or karatay, as some call it.

"Karatay"?

You should be making me
moneyay with your spatulay.

Now get back to work.

Ayay, capitay.

Nice hairpiece, Squidward.

SpongeBob, did you get
those bathrooms mopped yet?

Yes, ma'am... I mean, sir.

I mean, boss. I mean poohbah.

D'oh!

[someone sneezes]

Ha!

Sandy!

No more.

But, Mr. Krabs...

Shh!

No more of this karate stuff,
lad or you're fired.

Fired?

No more karate?

How am I going to tell Sandy?

Kiai!

Sandy, wait, I can't.

Mr. Krabs said
I have to give up karate.

Uhhuh, sure, SpongeBob.

No, really, Sandy, stop.

I'm not falling for it,
SpongeBob.

No, really!

Please stop.

What the... SpongeBob!

[screams]

Mr. Krabs.

What did I just get
through telling you, lad?

But, I... She...

SpongeBob, you're fired!

Huh?

Fired?

Hey?

SpongeBob?

[starts sobbing]

[bawling]

WaitMr. Krabs,
it's not his fault.

It's mine.

He tried to tell me,
but I wouldn't listen.

Give him another chance,
please?

Hmm.

All right, me boy,
I'll give you a second chance.

But no more karate.

It's poisoning your mind.

[sniffs]

Mmm, mammals.

Aw, shoot, SpongeBob.

I guess you ain't fibbing.

[both sigh]

Aw... That game
was getting old, anyway.

It's not fun anymore.

I mean, what's so fun about...

this?

[laughing]

Nothing!

Nothing is fun
about that at all.

We can find something to do

that's at least
nine times as fun.

We can?

I mean... Sure we can.

Yeah!

Like we can, uh...

We can squeeze things.

[grunting and groaning]

Whoohoo!
How much fun was that?

Almost some.

I know.
We can act like plants.

Photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis.

Want to go to the park?

Karate sure is dumb.

Yeah, you can say that again.

I feel dumb
just thinking about it.

Duh...

I'm stupid.

I like karate.

Doy...

You like what?

Not karate.

Ha! I don't even know
what that is.

Me too.
I don't know what anything is.

In fact...
Kiai!

Kiai!

[giggling]

For a second,
that sounded like...

Karate?
Right now?

I mean...
No, what is this karate?

Uh, what do you want
on your sandwich?

Karate.
What did you say?

Uh, mustardmustard.

I want mustard on my sandwich.

There we go.

How many slices
of barnacle loaf do you want?

One... Just one.

One for you...
Hmm?

And one for me!

Oh, uh... SpongeBob?

Maybe just one more.

I'm kind of hungry.

Sure thing, sandy.

SpongeBob?
Yeah.

Do you think, um...

Do you think
I could cut this one?

Uh, sure.

Thanks.

[yells]

Is that enough?

Maybe just one more.

Or two.

Or three.
Or ten.

Ten, yes, ten!

Because we're really hungry.

Right!
Right!

Right!
Right!

Time for buns!

[yelling]

How about some tomatoes?

And I'll cut the cheese.

[both yell]

And what else should we slice?
More buns!

And lettuce! Yeah!
Yeah!

[chopping frantically]

[panting]

Making sandwiches sure is fun.

Right, Sandy? Right?

I guess I'll eat one now.

You're mincemeat.

In your dreams!

[both yelling and shouting]

Huh? What the barnacle...?

Do you think Mr. Krabs
ever does karate?

[clears his throat]
[screams]

Mr. Krabs!

Uh, hey, Mr. Krabs,
how's it going?

Nice day, huh?

Oh, all right, Mr. Krabs,
you caught me.

But you know what?

I just can't help myself.

You're just going
to have to fire me.

Fire you?

I got something else in mind.

[fast chopping inside]

[crowd cheering]

[chopping continues]

[crowd cheering]

I love karate!

I love karatay!

I love moneyay!

I hate all of you.

Mrs. Puff, look!

I finally got my

Not even in your

No!

Ouch!

Where am I?

Is that me?

Or is this me?

GARY: [SNORING]

Am I still dreaming?

This must be Gary's dream!

I'm going to get a closer look.

Whoa!

Wow!

Look at all these books.

I wonder where Gary is.

Gary!

Huh?

Excuse me, sir, have you seen

[GASP]

SpongeBob?

Gary?

How dare you invade the
sanctity of my dreams?

Gary, you can talk!

[SIGH]

In dreams, one is not tethered
by earthly limitations.

What does that mean?

Come.

For ages, dreams
have been thought

of as windows to another realm.

"Let me not mar that perfect
dream by an auroral stain,

but so adjust my daily night
that it may come again."

Emily Dickinson wrote that.

Who?

Here's one you might know.

[CLEARS THROAT]

"There once was a
man from Peru, who

dreamed he was eating his shoe.

He woke with a fright in
the middle of the night

to find that his
dream had come true.

[LAUGH]

Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.

Did you think my shell
was full of hot air?

Well, thanks for
the info, Gary.

I'm going back to
my own dream now.

Beware of your wandering
eye, you little peripherin.

PATRICK: [SNORING]

I wonder what
Patrick's dreaming.

Hey, SpongeBob.

You know, Patrick,
this is a dream.

You can do anything you want.

Yep.

I mean anything.

Watch, I can turn
into a skyscraper.

Going up!

Huh?

I can make

[POPPING]

a million of me!

Huh?

Huh?

Yep.

Ah, tartar sauce.

I'm going to a different dream.

OK.

Well, we're freefalling

Oh.

He's next door.

Boys don't understand the

I got ya now, ya slippery demon.

You're putting up a

Whatcha doing, Mr. Krabs?

I'm picking Neptune's pocket.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about

It's the mighty Moby Dollar!

Did you see her, boy?

I got her.

Here she comes!

There she blows!

Look, Mr. Krabs, pennies!

Never mind the

Get the net!

This one?

No, no, no, no, no.

The money net, it's

Wow!

You look real good with
a mustache, Mr. Krabs.

Never mind that, boy.

Ready the net.

Net ready, sir!

[SPLASHING]

I did it!

I finally did it!

[SNEEZE]

Meow.

(SARCASTICALLY) No, Gary.

I like wearing my
underwear like this.

GARY: Meow.

I'm not sick.

I'm going to work.

[SNEEZE]

MR. KRABS: SpongeBob, what's
holding up those patties?

Right away, sir.

SpongeBob, what's
wrong with you?

You're paler than
a baby seahorse.

Meow.

The suds?

Here's that patty you
wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.

[SNEEZE]

All right, SpongeBob.

You're too sick to work.

No, Mr. Krabs.

I'm OK.
[SNIFFLE]

Honest.

No, now go home
and get some rest.

Nothing personal, lad.

I just can't have you
sneezing all over my food.

[SPITTING]

[SHOUTING]

No!

Wait!

Wait!

Oh, Gary.

[SNIFFLE]

I feel horrible.

[SNEEZE]

Oh, who am I kidding, Gary?

I've got the suds,
no doubt about it.

[SNEEZE]

I better take care of this
before it gets out of hand.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hello?

Sandy, I'm sick.

Can you escort me
to the doctor's?

Oh, sure, SpongeBob.

I'll be over there faster
than a barefoot jackrabbit

on a hot greasy griddle in
the middle of August with a

SPONGEBOB: Yeah, OK, Sandy.

Thanks.

[SNEEZE]

[DOORBELL RINGING]

Coming.

Hey, SpongeBob.

Going skiing?

I'm sick, Patrick.

I'm going to the doctor.

What?

Oh, you can't go!

Why not, Patrick?

I know a guy who knows a guy
who went to the doctor once,

and the doctor's office is
a horrible, horrible place.

It can't be as
horrible as the suds.

[SNEEZE]

Oh, it is, SpongeBob.

Well, first, they make you
sit in the waiting room.

Is that the horrible
part, Patrick?

No, it gets worse.

They make you read
old magazines!

[GASP]

Then the doctor pulls
out his stethoscope.

No!

Yes!

It's a device so sinister,
so icy cold when it

touches your bare flesh, it

[SIZZLING NOISE]

[SCREAM]

No!

No!

No stethoscope!

No doctor!

No magazines!

No psst!

No!

Patrick, I don't want
to go to the doctor!

Exactly.

SPONGEBOB: [SNEEZE]

You gotta help me
get better, Patrick.

Please?

Would you like to be
my doctor, Patrick?

What else are friends for?

[SNEEZE]

It appears as though we'll
have to plug up these holes.

This ought to do the trick.

Voila!

[SNEEZE]

Feel better?

I don't know.

[SNEEZING]

[GASP]

Help!

I'm shrinking!

No!

Please, don't hurt me!

No bubbles!

Patrick, your
treatment is working!

You think so?

Sure!

At this rate, I'll
be cured in no time.

In fact, I'm going to call
Sandy and tell her not to come.

Thanks, Dr. Patrick.

And they said I'd never
make anything out of myself.

[GRUNT]

[BEEPING]

My fingers are too
big for the buttons.

[DIAL TONE]

Dr. Patrick, could
you call Sandy for me?

Sure, Patient SpongeBob.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hello, Sandy.

Hiya, Patrick.

I'm calling on behalf of
my patient, SpongeBob.

I'm on my way over to
take him to the hospital.

Uh, uh, that will
no longer be required.

He is in my care as of today.

Well, I'm coming
over to take a look.

I'll be over there faster than a
barefoot jackrabbit on a high

Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit.

Don't bother, Sandy!

SpongeBob, quick!

Sandy's coming!

We've got to make
sure you're well,

or she'll take
you to the doctor!

Don't touch me, I'm sterile.

Scalpel, please.

Feeling better?

SPONGEBOB: Uhuh.

PATRICK: [GRUNT]

Feeling better yet?

Not really.

How about now?

[GROAN]

I don't think so.

Feeling better?

No.

[RIPPING]

[SCREAM]

How about now?
No.

[RIPPING]

[SCREAM]

How about now?

Uhuh.
[RIPPING]

[SCREAM]
SANDY: Hello!

SpongeBob?

[KNOCKING]

Uhoh.

It's Sandy.

[SNEEZE]

There's no one home!

Patrick, you open this door!

[SIGH]

Patrick, sometimes I just
don't understand you.

SpongeBob: [SNEEZE]

Hey!

OK, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?

Uh, uh, he's not
here at the moment.

Please leave a message
after the beep.

Beep.

OK.

Now tell me, since when
do you have two houses?

Since I ran out of
space to put more stuff.

Uhhuh.

Yeah.

Since when does your
house have feet?

This is my mobile home.

SPONGEBOB: [SNEEZE]

Hiya, Sandy.

Hmm.

The dirt therapy seems
to be working just fine.

Patrick, SpongeBob has
to see a real doctor.

No he doesn't!

I'm taking good care of him!

Show her, SpongeBob.

Say, "ahh."

Ahh.

[CHIRPING]

[CRACKING]

See, he's even
worse than I thought.

What do you mean?

He's fine!

[SMACK]

I'm OK, Sandy, really.

[SNEEZE]

I'm taking you to
the doctor right now!

[GRUNT]

Hey!

That's my patient!

You can't take him
to the doctor's!

SANDY: Don't be silly, Patrick!

PATRICK: He's mine!

SANDY: SpongeBob,
you'll be better soon!

I'll save you!

SPONGEBOB: I'm
[INAUDIBLE] better, guys!

Really!

[SHOUTING]

Now look what
you've done, Patrick!

What I've done?

Everything was fine
until you showed up.

You should be arrested
for impersonating a doctor.

Hey, I'm a good doctor.

Right, SpongeBob?

SPONGEBOB: Guys!
Huh?

SpongeBob?

SPONGEBOB: I can't stop!

[SCREAM]

Help me!

[SQUEAKING]

Shiny dimes.

Mr. Krabs!

SpongeBob?

[SCREAM]

Stop, SpongeBob!

Stop!

[EXHALE]

[SNEEZE]

DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Squarepants,
it seems you have the suds.

Are you ready for
your treatment?

You're not going to make me
read old magazines are you?

No, silly.

You get the sponge treatment.

Oh, Hans.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

SPONGEBOB: Woo!

Yeah!

Woo!

[LAUGH]

This tickles.

I can smell again!

Woo!

Yeah!

Yeah!

Woo!

Yeah!

I feel a good as new.

I love the doctor!

HANS: Here's your lollipop.

PATRICK: A lollipop?

Hey, Doc, well, I
got the suds too.

Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick.

We have a special
treatment for you.

PATRICK: [GIGGLE]

Hey.

Wait!

Ouch!

That hurts!

Hey!

Hey!

This doesn't seem right!

[MUSIC PLAYING]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]
[plays airy tune]

Happy Valentine's Day,
Bikini Bottom!

[crash]

Happy Valentine's Day,
SpongeBob.

I'm nuts for you.

Well, I'm bubbles for you,
Sandy.

Mmm, chocolate.

Mighty tasty.

Patrick's going to love the one
you made for him.

Take me through the plan again.

Okay.

Step one, Patrick and I get
to the Valentine's Day carnival.

Step two,
I position Patrick and myself

on top of the Ferris wheel.

Step three, you arrive at
designated checkpoint

for maximum visual contact.

Step four, Patrick is thrilled.

Mission accomplished.

[grunting]

Hi, Patrick.

Hello?

Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob,
what are you doing in there?

Patrick!
Oh my gosh! Sponge...

SpongeBob
is stuck inside this rock.

Oh, hold on, buddy!

I'll get you out!

SpongeBob?
SpongeBob?

Patrick!
SpongeBob!

[weeping]

SpongeBob...!

Patrick, I'm right behind you.

There you are.

Happy Valentine's Day.

Here's your present.

And I have a present for you.

You do?

It's the greatest...

Oh...!

The bestest...
Oh...!

The most fantabulous...

Oh...!
Present ever!

Oh...
Ooh...

Oh...!
But you can't have it yet.

Huh? Why not?

'Cause it's not ready yet.

Is it ready now?
Not yet.

How about now?

Do you want
to ruin the surprise?

Yes!
Uhuhuh.

Come on, please.

Hmm...

Nope, sorry.

You got to tell me!

No can do.
[laughs]

You'll just have to wait.

Please...! Oh, please, please.

Please, please, please.

Tell me, tell me, tell me...

Please!

Okay, Patrick, here we are.

[gasps]

You got me a carnival?

!

Mine!

All mine, mine, mine.

Mine, mine, mine.

All right, everybody out!

This is my carnival!

It's not the carnival.
Oh.

Here, why don't you
take this quarter and...

Oh my gosh, a quarter!

I've always wanted a quarter.

It's not the quarter.
Oh.

Now take that quarter
and buy some cotton candy.

Cotton candy,
I can't believe it!

Cotton candy!
Get away.

Sandy to SpongeBob.

Sandy to SpongeBob.

Come in, SpongeBob.

Tenfour, Sandy,
SpongeBob here.

I got a visual on the carnival.

You want me to bring her in?

Oh, not yet, Sandy.

Patrick's still trying to guess
what his valentine is.

You are such a kidder.
Sandy out.

That SpongeBob.

[clattering]

Scallops.

Chocolateeating scallops!

So if it's not cotton candy,
then what is it?

I can't take it!

You'll have to guess.

This tent.
No.

This guy?
No.

This paramecium?

[laughs]
Nope.

[chuckles]

You're a sly one.

I can't find it here
in the carnival

because it's on top
of mount climbupandfalloff!

[panting]

[screams]

It wasn't there, either.

Are you sure?

Uh!
[panting]

Sandy to SpongeBob.

SpongeBob to Sandy.

You can bring it in now.

SpongeBob, we've got ourself
a little problem.

I got a pack
of chocolateeating scallops

trying to rustle the balloon.

Get away,
you sweettoothed varmints!

[yelling]

I'm going to be a little late.

Late?
But what about...

[screams]

Patrick?
[yelling]

Take him up to the Ferris wheel
and I'll meet you there.

Sandy out.
[yelling]

If Patrick
doesn't get his valentine...

I'm pretty sure
it's not up there, SpongeBob!

[screams]

Patrick!

Actually it's on the Ferris...

Ferris wheel!

[panting]

I'm ready
for the greatest valentine

present in the whole world now,
SpongeBob.

Well, this is
where you're going to get it...

I hope.

Just keep looking out there,
pal.

Oh...
Ooh...

SpongeBob to Sandy,
SpongeBob to Sandy.

Come in, Sandy.

Sandy to SpongeBob.

I got my ox in a hitch here.

I'm way off course.

[yelling]

The scallops are eating
the balloon!

[yelling]

They're everywhere!

Huh?

Oh, shoot!

We're going down, SpongeBob.

Switch to Plan B.

No B, Sandy. No B.

No!

Oh...

Uh, Patrick,

you know how sometimes
you plan something special

and things just don't work out?

No, no...

Oh, gee...

Oh, holy mackerel.

Is it hot up here or what?

!

Valentine, valentine...
Huh?

No...

No, Patrick!

Valentine, valentine,
valentine...

Valentine, valentine...
Patrick, don't!

[grunting and yelling]

Patrick! Here it is!

What's that?

A handshake,
a friendly handshake.

A handshake?

That's the big gift?

You got me a handshake?

A friendly handshake.

Happy Valentine's Day!

[laughs nervously]

[sighs deeply]

I've been thinking.

At first a handshake
doesn't seem like much.

But...

Really
it's the thought that counts.

Hey, SpongeBob,

I just wanted to thank you
for this box of chocolates.

Uh, no problem, Fran.

I mean, even though
I was expecting more...

Thanks for the roses,
SpongeBob.

Happy Valentine's Day.

You too, Dave.

Not that it matters

that we've been friends
for so long...

Hey, SpongeBob,
thanks for the bike.

Can you believe this guy?

I just met him this morning.

So, as I was saying...

Excuse me,
do you guys have the time?

[screaming]
Ooh, Patrick needs love, too!

Ooh...!

[panting, yelling,
and screaming]

[yelling]

I defy you, heart man!

[screaming]

Attention, everyone.

There's a chubby pink
starfish on the loose!

[screaming]
[gibbering]

Heart on stick must die!

[screaming]

[grunting and screaming]

[panting]

Heart on stick must die!

[screaming]
[munching]

[gasps] Patrick!

[gibbering]

[scream]

[howling]

Give me SpongeBob!

[laughs nervously]

You broke my heart!

Now I'm going to break
something of yours!

Okay, Patrick, I know
I deserve this, but do they?

They didn't give me
anything, either.

Nope,
it's too late for that now...

for all of you.

[growling]

[screaming]

Yeeha!

Get along, little shellfish.

Giddap, you scallops!

Yeah, Sandy's here!

Whoohoo!
Look, Patrick, it's here!

It's here!

The best valentine

in the whole wide world
is right behind you!

Sure it is.

I'm telling you
it's right there.

Turn around!

Uhuh.
Patrick, just turn around.

Turn around!

Hey, nincompoop, turn around!

You must think
I'm pretty dumb, huh?

Yes!

Turn around!
No.

[chanting] Turn around,
turn around.

Nuhuh.

I'm going to say this once,

and I'm not going
to say it again,

so pay attention.

I am not, I repeat
not going to turn around

for any reason ever.

Howdy, Patrick!

Hi, Sandy.
[gasps]

[mumbling]

Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick.

Yay!

Yay!

My valentine!

Hey, is this solid chocolate?

Patrick, no!

[chomp]
[explosion]

Oh, SpongeBob,

you didn't
have to give me anything.

[humming]

Ah...

Time to relax.

[gasps]

Squidward!

Well, time to go.

Squidward!

Squidward, wait!
Now what?

You dropped
this piece of paper.

Yeah, so what?

I just figured you
probably want it back.

What's the big deal?
It's only garbage.

Garbage?
!

But, Squidward,

in the right hands this paper
is a gold mine of entertainment.

A spectacular afternoon
of underwater fun.

A treasure trove of...

Garbage.

So you don't want it?

Right!

Does that mean I can have it?

Yes, by all means, take it.

[phone rings]

Hello.

You sure?

Yes!

For the final time,
I don't want that paper.

It's yours forever and ever!

[sighs]

So are you definitely,
positively sure?

Get out!
But are you...

Get... out...!

Last chance to change your mind,
Squidward.

Take it, SpongeBob.

Take it, please.

And promise me, no matter

how much I may beg
and plead and cry,

don't give that paper
back to me ever!

So I take
that as a possible no?

Squidward?

Squidward?
Squidward?

Okay, Squidward,

that's a promise,
I'll just have to keep.

Ah, Mr. Paper,

I am so lucky
to have a friend like Squidward.

SpongeBob...

[SpongeBob laughing]

[playing
"Mary had a little lamb"]

[SpongeBob laughing]

What in the world
are you giggling about?

[laughs] I'm sorry, Squidward,
it's just...

[giggles]

It's just that I'm thinking
of all the fun

I'm going to have
with this piece of paper!

How can anyone have fun
with just a piece of paper?

[resumes playing]

[SpongeBob laughing and singing]

D'oh!

What can he possibly
be doing with that paper?

Lalalala, lalalala...

Gary, watch this.

Guess what I am?
[meows]

Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge
with paper stuck in his pants,

but I'm also super sponge
soaking up crime.

See, here's my cape.

Super moron's more like it.

Now I'm SpongeBob JunglePants.

[yelling like Tarzan]

Ugh...

SpongeBob JunglePants
summon animal friends.

[roaring]
[cawing]

[blows raspberry]
[screeching]

[imitating foghorn]
[chattering]

[barking]
[meows]

You're right, Gary.

I'm not a jungle boy.

I am a box of army supplies

Bringing relief
to the hungry troops!

Landing just in time for...

The bullfight!

Toro! Toro, Gary!

Toro, toro!

Toro... Gary.

Toro...

Hey, ole!

[crowd cheers]

Now for some impressions,
a guy with a mustache.

Look at me,
I'm a guy with a mustache.

A pirate with an eye patch.

Arr, I'm a pirate.

A regular guy with an eye patch.

Arr, I am not a pirate.

Do a big yellow idiot
with a stupid piece of paper.

How did he do that?

Look, Gary, oralgami.

Bird! Yay!

Snowflake! Yay!

Paper doll, yay!

Hey, that little paper
does seem like fun.

What am I saying?
!

I am such an idiot.

[laughs]

SpongeBob, honestly,
and his dumb paper.

He calls that fun?

Now reading boring science
digest, that's fun.

[muttering]
[laughs]

Check erosion!

[laughs]

Mitosis!

[SpongeBob laughing]

See,
I can have fun taking a bath.

[SpongeBob
making airplane noise]

[imitating machine gun]

[rubber duck squeaking]

Painting fruit

There's nothing more fun
than painting fruit.

This is more fun than anything.

[SpongeBob laughing]

[gasps]
[SpongeBob laughing]

Oh!

[grumbling]
[yelling]

[coughing and panting]

[SpongeBob laughing]

I'll prove to him
that paper is not fun!

[whistling]

I'm having fun, lalala

Isn't it great, lalalalala
♪

Lala.. Lalalala

Okay, SpongeBob,
top this one.

Hey, little Squidward,

what's gray and ugly
and has six arms?

I don't know, but have you
looked in the mirror lately?

What? Why you...

[laughing]

Oh, that's a good one,
Squidward, now let me try.

Have you heard any good jokes,
Mr. Paper?

What happened to the paper
that fell in the ocean?

I don't know.

What happened to the paper
that fell in the ocean?

It was all washedup.

[crowd laughing]

Lalalalalalala...

Ha, ha, I'm having so much fun
with my new shell cart.

Ah, ha, ha.

Hey, SpongeBob,
can your stupid paper do this?

[helicopter engine]

Nope.

Well, you can't play music
with a piece of paper!

[playing "Mary
had a little lamb" offkey]

Hooray! Hooray!

That was great, Squidward.

All those wrong notes you played
made it sound more original.

What?
I didn't play any wrong notes.

[plays offkey]

Yeah, see,
you're playing it like this...

[plays offkey]

When ordinarily
it goes like this...

[plays perfectly]

I'm partial to doing it
in the key of aminor, myself.

[playing jazzy version
in higher key]

Ah, nothing like a duet
between buddies, eh, Squidward?

Give me my paper back!

Now let go of it.

I said let go of it!

Let go, let go, let go...

I can't!

What do you mean you can't?
I can't!

You made me promise no matter

how much you begged
and pleaded and cried

not to give the paper
back to you ever.

I never said
anything like that.

Sure you did, Squidward, look.

Take it SpongeBob.
Take it, please.

And promise me,

no matter how much I may beg
and plead and cry,

don't give that paper
back to me ever!

Want to see it again?

No,
I don't want to see it again.

Just give me that paper.

Sorry, Squidward,
I am sworn to a promise.

Maybe I should get going.

Wait, wait, maybe we can
trade for something.

Yeah, something, something.

Ah...
Wait up, SpongeBob.

Wait!
Hold on there, chum.

[laughs]

I'm going to make you an offer.

Wow! Pocket lint!

You drive a hard bargain,
Squidward.

Paper for lint, hmm...

Not the lint, the rubber band.

The rubber band?

Do I dare?

Oh...
Dare! Dare!

Okay...

Oh, I get it.

You're just testing me.

Don't worry, Squidward,
I won't let you down.

A promise is a promise.

Listen, you, you are not going
anywhere until we strike a deal.

Got to get that...
paper.

Squidward?
Trade...

Hey, listen.

Everything must...

go!

Well, that's the last of it.

I've given you everything
but the shirt off my back.

Oh...

Squidward, is this still part
of the test 'cause it's...

It's really getting harder
and harder to keep my promise.

Okay, the shirt!

Take it, take my shirt!

Squidward's shirt.

I've always loved that shirt.

Okay, okay, I'll trade!

I can break a promise for this.

Squidward,
do you want your other stuff

'cause this is all I'll need.

You can have all that junk
'cause now I've got this.

I've got the paper,

and you've got my
useless garbage.

I got it! Ha, ha, ha.

You can't have it.

I got it, you're a sucker.

You're a sucker.

[laughs] At last.

What should we try first,
Mr. Paper?

Impressions!

A guy with a piece of paper
on his nose.

Look at me, I'm a guy
with a piece of paper...

on his...

nose.

Hmm...

Aha! Wait, wait, wait.

Tada!

Boo!

Okay, okay, uh...

Helicopter!

Gentlemen, start your engines.

I'm flying!

Oh, yeah, I'm flying!

I'm flying!

That's right, that's right,
here we go now.

I'm flying, flying, flying,
flying, flying, flying...

[wheezing] Flying...

[clarinet squeaking]

Wait, more impressions.

A guy throwing a piece of paper
on the ground!

A guy stomping
on the piece of paper!

I'm a guy who traded everything
he owns for...

A worthless piece of paper.

Hey, thanks, it's just
what I needed, Squidward.

[chewing]

Nice shirt, SpongeBob.

[chuckles]
[wind blowing]

Does anybody have
any sunscreen?
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[hearty laughter]

[flute playing]

Where can they be?

They should have been here
hours ago.

Arrgh.

Not a customer in sight.

If I don't make any money today
I'll surely break out in a rash.

Yippee!

I'm rich.

Look, Patrick,
eight gold doubloons.

Wait! I saw it first!

Yah!

Mine! Mine! Huh?

Boy, Mr. Krabs,
you sure are sweaty.

What's this?

Where are the doubloons?

[laughing]

There are no real doubloons,
Mr. Krabs.

It's a game.

The Flying Dutchman's
treasure hunt.

Based on a real treasure map.

Take a break
and play a round with us.

Yeah, come on, sweaty.

You finished
cleaning the tables?

I cleaned the tables,
Mr. Krabs.

Aye, but did you scrape
all the gum off the underside?

I already took care of it.

[laughs]

All right, lads.

Looks like you've shanghaied me.

My turn.

Five.

[blows raspberry]

"One of your shipmates
has been a bad pirate.

Send him to the brig!"

Hmm...

It's off to jail for you,
Mr. Krabs.

Patrick, you're fired.

But I don't even work here.

Would you like a job,
starting now?

Boy, would I!
?

You're fired.
My turn.

One, two, three, four.

"Look for the deacon's goose
thru the fork in the old tree

and head that way."

Well, I see Mr. Krabs',
zipper is undone.

Shiver me timbers.

[laughing]
Just kidding, Mr. Krabs.

I'm almost to the treasure.

Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.

I hope. Fisheyes.

One, two.

"You are a real pirate.

Go straight to the 'X'
which marks the spot."

You get to dig for treasure,
Mr. Krabs.

Treasure?

There it is.

It's the Flying
Dutchman's treasure.

Gold, gold, gold.
mine, mine, mine!

Hey!

Mr. Krabs is getting
all sweaty again.

Rev up those fryers,

'cause I am sure
hungry for one...

Help. Help. My leg!

Can't you see we're closed?

Ready for another round?

This is my kind of game.

Hooray!
Six.

One, two...
I win again!

Oh, that's 17 times in a row.

I think we ought to call it
a night, Mr. Krabs.

I really got to get some sleep.

Oh,
you can't walk out on me now.

I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.

See you tomorrow.

Huh?
Who's there?

Come on, SpongeBob.

One more game.

I can smell the treasure.

Mr. Krabs, it's late.

Go to bed.

Good night, Mr. Krabs.

The wind is perfect,
the tide is right.

Let's hunt for treasure.

Mr. Krabs, you got...

Tread softly, lad.

If the Dutchman hears you,
we'll never get his treasure.

But, Mr. Krabs...
I'll roll for you, boy.

But, mister...
Eight paces north.

That's a good start, lad.

But, mister...
One, two, three...

Mr. Krabs!

I want to go to bed!

Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but
it's just a game, you know?

A game.

That's right.

Of course it is.
My mistake.

I guess
I got a little carried away, eh?

Though it is treasure
we're dealing with here.

Sorry for disturbing you, lad.

Avast!

Pineapple ho!

Heave to and prepare to be
boarded!

Oh, go home already.

I'm done playing that game,
Mr. Krabs.

That's Captain Krabs to you
and this is no game.

We're going to be pirates.

Pirates?
Aye!

How'd you like to go on
a real treasure hunt?

With a real treasure map?

treasure?
Treasure?

We're gonna be pirates!

We're gonna be pirates!

Hey, hey, belay that skipping.

Pirates don't skip.

Put on this pirate garb
so I won't be embarrassed

to be seen with you.

Arrgh.
Oh, Patrick, look.

Peg legs and eye patches.

Now, don't you feel
more like pirates?

Look, I'm Peggy the pirate.

Uh, oh...

I'm Blindbeard, the pirate.

Oop.
Ow!

Arrgh.

Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob.

According to the map

we're close
to the first landmark.

Really?

Can we see the map?

Uh...
no.

Only the captain
can lay eyes on the map.

Okeydokey, then.

Arrgh.

A pirate doesn't say
"Okeydokey, then."

A pirate says, "arrgh."

Oh, okey...
oop.

Hahaha.
I mean...

arrgh, Captain Krabs.

Captain, we're about to hit...

I mean...
arrgh, capt...

Uh, we're arrgh, about arrgh...

to hit, arrgh...

Out with it, man.
Arrgh.

I, arrgh, think, arrgh

he's trying,
arrgh to say, arrgh...

land.

Arrgh.

From now on,
only the captain says, "Arrgh."

Status report, Mr. SquarePants.

The whole ship is underwater,
captain.

Arrgh.

We're marooned, then.

Our treasure hunt
will have to continue on foot.

This is it, boys.

"From the seaweed
with two leaves on it,

10,000 paces east."

But, Mr. Krabs,
that seaweed has...

Which way, Cap'n?

Ensign Patrick,
which way is east?

Uh...
Let's see.

That way, Cap'n.

9,997... 9,998...

9,999...

10,000.

Where's the "X"?

It's supposed to be right here.

10,000 paces east.

Oh...

East?

I thought you said "Weast."

"Weast"?

What kind of compass
are you reading, lad?

This one, sir.

That's west, Patrick.

You're fired again.

9,551...

9,552...

Mr. Krabs, we're tired.

And hungry.

Oh.

So this is my crew?

You get a little tired
and a wee bit hungry...

and you want to shove off
for home.

Arrgh. That sickens me.

A pirate is not judged
by the notches in his cutlass

or the size of his booty.

A pirate is judged
by the loyalty of his crew

and without a loyal crew
what am I Captain of?

Just a bunch of sand.

[sobs]

Don't cry, Captain Krabs.

Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.

[both sobbing]

You'll stay with me, then?

We'll be the most
loyal pirate crew ever!

I knew I could count on you,
boys.

One for all...

And all for one!

I'm so loyal I don't even mind
sleeping on the cold,

hard ground while Captain Krabs
sleeps in his warm, dry tent.

I'm so loyal
I haven't bathed in weeks.

But we've only been
out for a few hours.

I know...

[snickering]

I'm so loyal,

I don't want to sleep
till we find the treasure.

Let's see
if the captain will go now.

Captain Krabs!

He's not here.

Look.
The treasure map.

Only the captain
can look at the map, Patrick.

Yeah.

Patrick, what are you doing?

Nothing.

Patrick, you're not supposed
to look at the map.

I'm not looking, I'm touching.

There's no rule against that,
is there?

No, guess there isn't.

[squeaking]

Oops.
Patrick, it opened by itself.

[both laughing]

[chattering]

SpongeBob.
Yeah?

Did you notice
something familiar

about this map?

You mean like
that it's our game board

taped to a piece of paper?

Do you think this is a problem?

[crew yelling]

Sneaking peeks
at me treasure map.

That's mutiny on my ship.

So you think ol' Captain Krabs
has gone crazy, do ye?

Not at all, Cap'n Krabs.

We don't think that at all.

I think that.

I'm going to throw you overboard
for saying that.

[gibbering]

Oh, look.

It's the "X."

X marks the spot.

Wow.

That game really is based
on a real treasure map.

What are you waiting for lads?

Dig! Dig!

Dig, dig, dig, dig,
dig, dig, dig, dig.

We've got it, Cap'n Krabs.

Haha.
Hand it up to me, lads.

Heave!

We've finally found it.

The Dutchman's treasure

Wow.
Wow.

What are you going to do
with your share, Patrick?

I don't know.

How are you going to spend
your share, SpongeBob?

What shares?

You're not getting
any of my treasure.

We found it together
so we deserve a share.

Well, I'm the captain
and I say it's mine.

What about loyalty?

All for one.

And one for all.

All for one.

...and one for all.

All for one.

I'm the Flying Dutchman.

I'm the Flying Dutchman.

Who dares
wake the Flying Dutchman?

Keep it down, will you!

I'm trying to get some sleep.
Uh.

All for one.

One for all.

[thunderclap]

Who dug up
the Dutchman's treasure?

They did!

Arrgh.

So you two scallywags
dug up me treasure.

Well, you saved me
a lot of digging, you did.

So here's a reward
for the two of yous.

Wow.

Two gold doubloons.

Wait!
I'm captain of this crew.

Where's my reward?

Hmm.

I guess you're right.

A little something
for your trouble.

Gold, gold, gold, gold.

Huh?

Well, it's just a little
plastic treasure chest.

Plastic!

Aye, but it's based
on a real treasure chest.

[loud laughter]

Gee, Mr. Krabs,
you're looking all sweaty again.

Another funtastic day
at Glove World.

[grunting]

[clearing throat]

Let me get my wallet.

[grunting]

Wait, let me check...

[grunting]

No...

Patrick, do you have any change?

How much do you need?

How much is it?

50 cents.

50 cents.

Let me check...
Forget it.

What did you say?
Just take your seat!

Thanks, mister.
Yeah, whatev...

[snoring]

Show me what you got
at Glove World.

Okay, here's my glove light.

Wow.

I see you.

[both laughing]

I got gloves
for my glove action figure.

Cool!

Hey, SpongeBob.

Yeah, Patrick?

Where's
"Leaving bikini bottom"?

Where did you see that?

We just passed the sign.

"You are now
in leaving bikini bottom."

Oh! What?

What's wrong, SpongeBob?

Patrick, I think

we're on the wrong bus!

[teeth chattering]

Whoa!

[chuckling]

But, sir, we need to get back
to bikini bottom.

Oh, well.

[tires screeching]

Where is this, SpongeBob?

"Rock bottom."

It sure is weird around here.

Kind of different.

Even the soil looks different.

Would you mind putting me down?

[gasping]

Bob, I don't like it here.

It's dark and scary.

I don't want to be here.

I want to go home! Look!

II can't even tell
the bathrooms apart!

[toilet flushing]

Uh...
That's an easy one, Patrick.

Uh, just wait for someone

to come out
and then you'll know.

[groaning]
[gasping]

Maybe we should wait
for one more.

Ugh.
Ooh.

Ooh.
Eee.

[both gasping]

Oh.
Aah!

I still can't read the sign.

I want to go home!

Uh... uh... okay.

You wait for the bus,
call me if it comes,

I'm going to get a bus schedule.

Boy, this place sure is creepy.

Hey, SpongeBob! Bus is here!

[panting]

[crying]

SpongeBob!

[panting and gasping]

[sighs]

Well, I guess grandpa
SquarePants was right

"Don't run for a bus...

especially one that's going
up at a 90degree angle."

I'd better go
wait for the next one.

Come on, bus!

I got to get home and feed Gary!

Uhoh.
Shoe's untied.

Under...

and over...

and loopdeloop...
and over...

and...
through the bell.

Wait!

[wind whistling]

My balloon!

[panting and grunting]

Wait!

Hold on!
Stop that bus!

Aw, not again!

Um, excuse me, sir.

Can you help me?

[raspberry]

Uh...
uh, yeah, I...

No...
no!

Not the balloon!

I need to know
when the next bus comes.

[screaming and panting]

Well, there goes another one.

I got to be more diligent.

I am not leaving this spot
no matter what!

[stomach growling]

Getting hungry.

Glove candy dispenser.

Good thing
I went to glove world.

Ah, ah, ahahah.

[chewing loudly]

Ew! Gloveflavored!

Hey! What's that?

Candy machine.

Mmm.

Kelp nugget crunch.

Mmm.

[wind whistling]

I'm not leaving this spot
no matter what!

[stomach growling]

I'll only be gone a second.

Hey!

[frustrated grunt]

[stomach growling]

Wait!

Come on, come on!

[frustrated grunt]

[bus engine revving]

[laughing]

[frustrated grunt]

Hey!

That was mine!

Barnacles!

All right, that's it!

No more Mr. Nice Guy!

Tartar sauce!

Fish face!

I'm getting to the bottom
of this right now!

I want a bus to bikini bottom!

I am first in line and no one
is going to tell me otherwise!

[bubbly growling]

Okay, second.

I am second in line.

[fierce growling]

Okay, third is good!

[screeching]
Fourth, not bad.

[panting]

Okay...

329.

I am 329th in line
and nobody forget it.

[raspberry]

[groaning]

Next.
[raspberry].

Well,
at least the line is moving.

[raspberries]

[angry grunt]

Tartar sauce!

[angry sputtering]

Next. Next.

[snoring]

Next.

Next!

Huh?
Next?

FinallyYes, I'm next!

When is the next bus
to bikini bottom?

What?

The bus schedule.
The next bus?

I can't understand your accent.

The next bus to bikini Bottom?

Oh...

Why didn't you say so?

Next bus leaves in five seconds.

Ooh, tough luck, kid.

That's the last one
till morning.

Oh, no, you don't!

Good night.

Hold it!
I'm not through here.

Do you hear me?

I demand you come back

and get me a bus
to bikini bottom right now!

Until then,
I am not leaving this spot!

Uh...

[giggling]

Okay, like I said I'll be
right here when you get back...

at this spot...

in the dark by myself
with no one around,

except my glove light!

Ah, that's better.

[sparking and raspberry]

This isn't your average
everyday darkness.

This is...

advanced darkness.

Hey, if I close my eyes
it doesn't seem so dark.

[distant raspberry]
Who's there?

Well, I guess that spot
will be there tomorrow.

I think I'd better
just keep walking.

[raspberry]
Running.

Better start running,
running, running.

[raspberry]
Sprinting!

Yes!
I just got to keep sprinting!

Sitting... sitting... bleeding.

Hey... Who's there?

[raspberry]

Okay, that's enough.

[raspberry]

Don't come closer!

[raspberry]

I'm warning you!
[raspberry]

I'm a sponge!

[screaming]
[raspberry]

Oh, it's only you.

Well,
that solves my balloon problem

but I've got a bigger problem

I'm kind of stuck here.

I need to catch a bus
to get home.

You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

Balloon has enough air, thanks

[raspberries]

Hey, I get it.

Balloon travel.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Ah, home at last.

Don't worry, SpongeBob,
I'm coming back for you!
Are you ready, kids?

Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[hearty laughter]

[flute playing]

Good morning, bikini bottom.

Ah, what a beautiful day.

Doodoodoodoo, doodoodoo

I wonder if Patrick's at home.

Hiya, SpongeBob.

What are you doing?

Going over to Sandy's place.

Hey, what's this?

This doesn't look
like Sandy's place.

Don't lose your barnacles,
boys.

There it is.

What is it?

Can't you see?

It's Texas.

"Texas"?
What's a Texas?

Oh,
it's nothing but a memory now.

All right, then.

Uh, let's make
one of your tree dome.

Yyou know, all of a sudden

I don't feel much
like sandcastles, SpongeBob.

I'll see y'all later.

Hmm? Sandy...

Ha ha ha hiya!

Aw, SpongeBob, I'm just not
feeling up to karate right now.

[laughing]

I get it.

"Not feeling up to karate," huh?

Whatever you say, Sandy.

Boy, I hope Sandy
doesn't attack me from behind.

Wah!

[growing]

[grunting and groaning]

Uh... Sandy?

Surf's up, Sandy.

No thanks.

[jellyfish buzzing]

Boy, there's nothing like
going jellyfishing.

[giddy laughter]

Whoa!

[giddy laughter]

Look, Sandy, we caught one!

Listen, SpongeBob, right now,
I don't want to build

sandcastles play karate
or eat jellyfish.

[laughing]

We don't eat 'em!

We let 'em go!

Fly away, little critter!

Go on, go back home
where you belong.

Run along, back
to your family and friends.

I know they miss you
as much as you miss them.

Hurry, before they forget you
and leave you behind!

Remember

There's no place like home

[sobbing]

[gurgling sobs]

[flushing]

[gasping]

Sandy, what the heck
are you crying about?

I ain't cryin',
my helmet just sprung a leak.

Sandy...

Oh, I guess I'm just feeling
a little homesick.

Homesick, huh?

Mmmmm.

Almost there!

Dadgum it,
SpongeBob, what is it?

Da, tada!

Welcome home, Sandy!

[sobbing]

Sandy?
Go away.

I don't get it, Patrick.

What's wrong with Sandy?

Maybe
it's just a squirrel thing.

[tuning]

Wish I was back in Texas

The ocean's no place
for a squirrel

Wish I was in Texas

Prettiest place in the world

Oh, no

I guess adeep in my heart

I'll always be a Texas girl

I want to go hooooome

Hoome

[clams howling]

[sandy yodeling]

Hey, Patricklisten to that!

Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

Patrick!

Listen... hear that?

It's Sandy.

I want to wake up in Texas

I miss those wideopen skies

[chittering]

I miss my 20 acres

Barbecues and pecan pies

Oh, why

When I'm so far from you,
Texas

All I can do is cry

[sobbing]

[music continues]

[sniffing]

[sobbing]

[sandy yodels]

[sobbing]

[blowing]

I want to go hoooome

I want to go hoome.

[sobbing loudly]

Do you think she knows
the muffin man song?

Patrick, she sang
that song from her heart!

She really misses Texas.

Well, let's go get some Texas
and bring it down here.

Patrick, you can't...

That's it!

Patrick, your genius is showing.

Where?

Everything looks perfect.

We're going to go get Sandy now.

Well, hurry it up, lads!

Can't squat like this forever!

Krusty Krab!

Krusty Krab!

Sandy's surprise
is at the Krusty Krab!

Wait'll she sees the...

shh!

Don't spoil the surprise.

[giggling]

Hey, Sandy!
Hey, Sandy!

You want to come with us
to the Krusty Krab?

Hey, SpongeBob.

Hey, Patrick.

What are you doing
with those bags?

I'm goin' back home to Texas.

What? Now?

You can't! I mean, we...

It's time for this tumbleweed
to tumble on home.

Wwait, Sandy. You can't, uh...

'cause we were gonna...
at the Krusty Krab is...

that is not
the right direction...

Wait! If you don't...

If I can't...

[sputtering]

Sandy, wait a second!

You don't want to leave without
having one last Krabby Patty

down at the Krusty Krab!

I'm tired of fish food,
SpongeBob.

Bbut sandy,

don't you want to say goodbye
to all your friends down

at the Krusty Krab?

I just can't do that,
SpongeBob.

It'd be too sad.

Nno, no, wait!

Sandy!

I can't believe she's gone.
Yeah.

What's so great about dumb,
old Texas?

What did you say?

Texas is dumb?

Don't you dare take
the name of Texas in vain!

You mean we can't say anything
bad about dumb, old Texas?

No, you can't!

Oh, then, can we say
people from Texas are dumb?

No!

You can't say nothin'
about Texas!

Oh!

So we shouldn't say
anything bad about Texas!

I'm warning you, SpongeBob!

Look, PatrickI'm Texas!

Duh, howdy, y'all!

I'm Texas, too.
Howdy, y'all!

Get a dog, little longie.

Howdy, y'all!

Howdy, y'all!

Get a dog, little longie!

Get a dog...

Y'all best cut it out!

The stars at night
are dull and dim

Whenever they have to be

Over dumb,
old, stupid Texas!♪

Hey, Patrick, what am I now?

Uh... stupid?

No, I'm Texas!

What's the difference!

[guffawing]

You all best apologize

or I'm going to be
on you like ugly on an ape!

You'll have to catch us first!

[taunting laughter]
[both panting]

We did it.

We got her.
Krusty Krab, here we come!

Can we say that plants
from Texas are dumb?

[guffaws]

Can we say that shoes
from Texas are dumb?

Uh, okay, Patrick,
that's enough.

Why?

Do you think that old slowpoke,
Texas, is gonna...

[screaming]

Run faster, Patrick!

[both screaming]

[screams]

SpongeBob!

[screaming]

[gasping]

[teeth chattering]

Hiya!

[gasping]

You're going to take back
what you said!

[sputtering and gasping]

No!

Almost there.

[grunting]

[screaming]

SpongeBob!

You been messin' with the bull!

Now here come the horns!

No, Sandy!

No!

Howdy, y'all!

Wha...
what's this?

It's a party.

For you!

For me?

It's your own little
slice of Texas.

Check it out, Sandy.

We got square dancin'...

Giant barbyq's...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

Homemade peasinacan pies

and we got our
very own tengallon hats.

So, what do you think?
You gonna stay?

[laughing]

[gurgling laughter]

Don't cry anymore, Sandy.

I'll go get your bags.

[gurgling continues]

[flushing]

I'm not cryin'.

I'm laughin'.

I appreciate what y'all are
trying to do, SpongeBob,

but home isn't about
barbecues and pecan pies.

Home is where you're surrounded
by other critters

that care about you.

Huh? Duh, what am I doin'?

I been home all along

and I took me till
just now to realize it.

Does that mean you'll stay?

I'm stayin'!

[all cheering]

Whoohoo!
She's stayin'!

Whoo!

That makes me feel all wiggly!

Yeah, who needs dumb,
old Texas?

What did you just say?

Should I start running now?

[evil laughter]

Attention, beachgoers!

You are trespassing!

You have exactly 17 minutes

to haul your carcasses off
of the future site

of the chum bucket mega bucket.

Do you hear something?

[garbled loudspeaker]

Okay, have it your way!

I don't mind bulldozing
over each and every one...

Mommy, look.

Somebody left
this toy tractor here.

Put that down, Billy.
That has germs on it.

Oh...

Aw, mom...

You'll see!

You'll all see!

The future site
of the chum bucket mega bucket

must be cleared of these
cretinous beachgoers

but it's becoming
increasingly obvious!

I can deny it no longer!

I am small.

I need someone big
to clear the beach for me.

I need...

SpongeBob.

Steppin' on the beach,
rooto totoo

Steppin' on the beach,
rooto totoo

Steppin' on the beach,
rooto totoo

Steppin' on the beach,
rooto totoo

Yes.

He's the one.

[evil laughter]

I'll have one...

Two please.

Thanks.

One, please.

Excuse me.

One, please.

Sorry, kid, we're all out.

Aw, Barnacles.

[sobbing]

Plankton,
what are you doing here?

And why are you crying?

Oh, hi, SpongeBob.

I'm crying because I've got
these two ice cream cones

but I only need one.

[sobbing]

I don't know what to do
with the other one.

[sobbing]

I'll eat one of those
ice cream cones for you.

SpongeBob,
would you do that for me?

Sure.

SpongeBob.

SpongeBob.

SpongeBob!
Yeah?

Isn't it great
to get the things you desire?

Like that ice cream cone,
for instance.

You can have anything
you want with a little training.

Training?
Yes.

You just have to learn to be
more assertive,

and I can show you how.

Assertive, huh?

That's right.

Anything I want?

Sounds great!

Wonderful.

[evil laughter]

SpongeBob.

Don't let that guy sit on you.

Assertiveness lesson number one.

Tell him to get off.

Um...

excuse me, sir.

Yyou're sitting on my body
which is also my face.

No, no, be assertive.

Beepbeep.

Not insertive.

SpongeBob,
you missed your chance.

You've got to be aggressive
to get the things you want.

You're too soft.

But I'm a spong...
Don't say it.

[slurping]

There's the guy
who took your ice cream.

Don't you want it back?

Ice cream.

Listen, you.

My friend's
got something to say.

What? Who said that?

Was it you?

Tell him off, SpongeBob.

Assert yourself.

That's my ice cream cone.

Great!

Now let him have it!

You can have it.

Say, thanks.

No!

I'll show you how.

Hey, pencilneck!

Yeah, you!
Slither over here!

Surrender that ice cream cone
or every waking moment

for you will become

a swirling torrent
of pain and misery!

[sobbing]

Hey, that guy was crying.

Those were tears of joy.

He was happy
that you were assertive.

Yeah!

You see how wonderful
life can be

when you're maniacal?

Uh, I thought
it was called assertive.

Whatever.

Well, if it got me
this ice cream then I like it.

[beeping]

I found something.

Uh, excuse me,
my metal detector broke.

Can I use yours?

Sure.
SpongeBob.

This is your next lesson.

Be aggressive.

Tell that guy to take a hike.

Do you want to take a hike
with me?

Yeah.

Now look what you've done!

Tell that guy
to go fall in a ditch.

Hey, go check in that ditch.

Wow. Buried treasure.

Thanks.

Did you see that, Plankton?

That guy found some
buried treasure.

SpongeBob,
you'll never get it right.

Tell that guy you know karate
and you'll tie him in a knot

if you don't get
your metal detector back.

Hey!
I'm going to tie your...

shoe if you
don't give that back!

But I'm wearing sandals!

Okay! Never mind!

It's all right, Plankton.
He's wearing sandals.

What's the matter?

Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.

Mama!

I was just beginning to think
that this is a waste of time.

No, it's not.

Forget it.

I guess you don't have

what it takes to be
a standup guy.

Well, what about airline food?

What?
Airline food!

My gosh,
what is up with that stuff?

Thank you. Good night.

[rimshot]

See, I can be a standup guy.
See?

SpongeBob, you'll never get
what you want.

You always let people step
all over you.

You're just like stairs.

Wait, Plankton,
give me another chance.

Okay,
but this is your last chance.

Look at all those beach hogs
soaking up your sun rays.

Do you have
what it takes to get a tan?

Just watch me!

[all coughing]

Man, this thing is san...

dy!

Yes,
my plan is beginning to work.

They're leaving the beach.

SpongeBob, that was wonderful.

Is that an allover tan?

Well, not all of me.

Hot dogs!

Hot dogs!

Look at that huge line
at the hot dog stand.

Assert yourself to the front.

I'll do better than that.

Let's go home.

SpongeBob, that was genius.

Look at all those kiteflyers
blocking your view.

What?
Breaking your wind.

Ahahahahahaha!

[growling]

Hey, SpongeBob,
throw us the ball.

[trumpeting]

What do we do now?

Let's just go home, I guess.

Ha!
Plankton, did you see that?

I was a regular alpha male.

[panting]

Plankton?

[engine starting]

Huh?

Plankton, all my asserting
has driven everybody away.

Exactly.

You didn't tell me
everyone would leave.

Oops.

Mega bucket!

You used me
for land development.

That wasn't nice.

Haven't you figured it out,
SpongeBob?

Nice guys finish last.

Only aggressive people
conquer the world.

[evil laughter]

Well...

what about aggressively
nice people?

Huh?

What are you doing?

Hot dogs! Yay!

[panting]

[cheering]

Wait.

SpongeBob, stop!

Butterfly kisses.

I... can't take it.

It's too cute.

It's, it's disgusting!

What happened?

I hit a reef
with my new board, dude.

No problem.

Whoa!

Color!

SpongeBob, stop
before it's too late.

Your kindness
is bringing everybody back.

Get back!

Wait!

Ooh! Ouch! Ow!

Ow! No! Ooh! Ow!

Cowabunga!

Thanks, dude.

That was awesome.

[groaning]

Gee, Plankton.

I'm sorry about the chum bucket.

Forget about that.

I just can't take so much
kindness at one sitting.

Need... hatred.

Volleyball, anyone?

Yeah!
Service!

[laughing]
Ouch.

[laughing]
Ouch.

[laughing]
Ouch.

Oh! who lives in a pineapple
under the sea

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense
is something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[countrystyle
acoustic interlude]

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[hearty laughter]
Are you ready, kids?

Aye aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

[snores, meows]

[snores]

[meows]
Wake up, Gary.

[meows quizzically]

We're moving today.

[meows]

That's right.
We're leaving home.

We're going to become peasants.

[meows]

No more food.

Sorry, Gary.

Peasants only eat
mashedup clamshells.

[sobbing meow]

[sobbing]

April fools!

There you go, pal.

Whoo, I'm thirsty.

This is an extreme thirst.

Whew. I'm exhausted.

I sure can't wait to drink
all these drinks.

April fools!

To me.

[braying laughter]

[laughing]

Hmm.

What's he so happy about?

April 1st?

April fools' day
is SpongeBob's favorite holiday.

Mr. Krabs,
I can't come in today.

I caught something terrible.

What'd you catch?

I caught sight of the calendar.

Oh. Hold on, Squidward.

There's someone here to see you.

Says he's from the barnacle bay
art museum

and he wants to honor you
as artist of the month.

I have arrived.

[giggling]

What? What's so funny?
Where's the art dealer?

[laughing]

You just missed him.

Yeah,
but he told us to tell you...

[snickering]

Hey, tell me what?

He told me to tell you

April Fool.

Well,
it's been nice working here.

Thanks for everything,
Mr. Krabs.

Squidward, wait.

Just send my last check
to the P.O. Box, Mr. Krabs.

Squidward, it was just a joke.

No more jokes on you today.
I promise.

You do?
Sure.

There's lots
of other willing participants.

Right, Mr. Krabs?

[raspberry]

[laughing]

Well, as long as it's not me.

Excuse me.

Could you tell me
where the forks are?

They're right here, lady.

Oh, but this is a spoon.

April Fools!

Oh.

[laughs]

Huh

Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

How may I help you?

Yeah.

Give me two large fries
and a jumbo krabby patty.

Hey, what's that?

Oh, I didn't see anything...

Hey, where'd that other guy go?

April fools!

I'm right here.

[laughs]

Hey, that was pretty good.

[laughs]

What are you doing
behind the counter?

Excuse me.

Can I get a couple ice cubes
in here please?

Sure.

A couple of ice cubes coming up.

[whistling]

Here you go.

Thanks.

[wheezing squeak]

Huh?

[chuckling squeak]

Hmm?

[slurps]

Ah...

[laughing]

April fools!

what did you do to my drink?

I... I...

You what?

You asked for a couple
of ice cubes in your drink

and I only put in one!

[laughs]

I guess that is pretty funny.

[laughs]

Yeah.

[SpongeBob laughing]
[grumbling]

[laughter continues]

Hey,

your shoe's untied.

April fools!

You're not wearing shoes.

[laughing]

[laughing into microphone]

April fools!

Oh! That's it!

SpongeBob and his stupid pranks.

I'm going to show him
what a real prank is all about.

[chortles]

[humming]

Hmm?

Oh, boy.

Something for me to clean up.

[snickers]

April fools!

Whoa!

Whoa!

[SpongeBob screaming]

Oh, no.

[laughing hysterically]

[SpongeBob screaming]

[all gasping]

[continues laughing]

[continues screaming]

[all gasping]

Oh, oh, ow.

I'll catch you, SpongeBob.

[snickering]

[SpongeBob screaming]

Oops.

[customers' dismayed gasps]

April fools!

You little sausage.

[laughing]

[whimpers]

[sobbing]

SpongeBob, I was just kidding.

Come on, come on.

You guys know
I was just kidding.

Right?

Oh, man, poor kid.

That guy has definitely got
some issues to work out.

April fools... jerk.

Wait, don't go.

Hey, you stink!

Wait, wait, wait.
It was a joke.

Uhhuh.

Oh...

Oh...

[groaning]

Why is it
whenever I'm having fun,

it's wrong?

I didn't mean to make him cry.

I guess this means
I better tell SpongeBob

I'm sorr... ech...

I guess this means
I better apolog... eeyi!

This is going to be tougher
than I thought.

[clears throat noisily]

SpongeBob?

Uh, SpongeBob, come on out.

I've got something to tell you.

SpongeBob?

Oh, huh?

SpongeBob,

uh, I was thinking about today
and...

and, well, it just seems

that maybe I might owe you
some sort of...

this isn't something
I normally do.

So, so, listen carefully,
SpongeBob,

because I'm about to tell you

that I'm... that I'm...

what?

Patrick,
what are you doing here?

Digging.
Why are you wearing that hat?

Oh, I don't know.

Oh. Where's SpongeBob?

He's in the house.

He's impressed.
With what?

I don't know

but it must have been
pretty good

to make him cry like that.

Oh!

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob, let me in there.

SpongeBob,
you better let me in there.

I don't want to have
to use this.

[playing outoftune melody]

What do you want?

SpongeBob,

I just want to say

that I'm soooo... rry.

What?

I'm trying to say I'm...

[brays like a donkey]

What?

I'm just trying to say I'm...

there's got to be an easier way
to do this.

[humming]

Well,
aren't you going to open it?

I can't.
I don't have a bottle opener.

Oh!

SpongeBob, I'm...

[whispering]

[sawing noises]

What?

Whwhwhat?

Oh!

SpongeBob,

all I am trying to say

is that I am...

sorry.

There you go.

But I couldn't...
I don't care.

I said it.

My conscience is clear.

Must have been pretty good
to make him cry like that.

What?
April fools... jerk.

You stink!

All right, all right,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I admit it, I'm sorry!

I didn't mean to hurt you.
In fact, SpongeBob, I like you.

I like living next door.

I like your foghorn alarm
in the morning

and your highpitched giggling
at night.

I also like Gary,
Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs

and all of the other people

I'm forced
to be in contact with.

Andandandand...

Squidward, is all that true?

Yes, yes, SpongeBob.

Yes, it's all true.

Even the part
about the lima beans

and the car chase?

The what?

Yes, yes, whatever

but you have to promise
not to tell anybody.

I promise.

Really?

April fools!

[muttering gibberish]

April fools!

You're rightApril fools.

I just fooled you all.

[laughing hysterically]

What would we do
without Squidward?

Ah!

Ooh!
Oh!

Ooh!
Ah!

Ooh!

Ah!

Ooh!
Ah!

Behold
the ultimate cooking utensil

the golden spatula!

Hey, SpongeBob,
look what it says here,

"Many have tried
to pull this spatula"

from this ancient grease

and all have failed.

[grunting loudly]

"Only a fry cook worthy
of King Neptune himself

can wield...

The golden spatula."
The golden spatula."

Wow.
Wow.

Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Take a picture of me
and the spatula.

Okay, I'm ready!

Excuse me...

do you know
where the menu section is?

Uh...

The menu section?

That's easy.
It's over that way.

Uhoh.

Holy smokes!

Rude!

Hey, the light changed.

Uh, Patrick...

Hold on. Almost there.

[booming laughter]

Yes, yes, at last

someone worthy
of being the royal fry cook!

Who has freed the spatula
from the grease?

Uh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir.

SpongeBob SquarePants.

[rumbling]
[laughing]

[rumbling stops]
A fine jest, boy.

You are but a lowly
yellow sponge.

Puny...

insignificant...

a commoner.

Therefore,
you could never be fry cook

to a god and...

this is why it is funny!

[rumbling]

[laughing]

Now step aside

while I seek out
the true fry cook.

No, no, no... hmm...

no, not you,
you're too short, no.

Ah!

But... but...

A purveyor of foods.

Yes,

you must be my new fry cook.

Uh, sorry, King Neptune.

I don't make them,
I just sell them.

Then who pulled up the spatula?

Well, he did.

[laughing]

It is even funnier
a second time.

You, therecrustacean!
Who, me?

You have the physique of atlas.

Thanks. I work out.

[laughing]

Make poses with me.

Okay.

[both grunting]

Body slam!

You pulled the spatula
from the grease.

Nope, that was SpongeBob.

This joke has gone far enough!

Where's my fry cook?

Certainly you
with your prodigious girth

would know who can flip a burger
to suit a royal palate!

What?

Am I expected to believe

this creature
is royal fry cook material?

I don't suppose
you have any proof.

Ha!

This thing is unfit

to even scrub
the royal tail fin!

And besides,
it's not just enough

to pull a spatula off
a greasy griddle,

there are certain...

qualities that a royal fry cook
must have.

Like?

The royal fry cook must be...

Oh, lefthanded.

Actually, I've got two.

[fingers snapping]

Also,
the royal fry cook wears...

the red underwear.

No, blue.

Oh!

The royal fry cook's
wallet contains

his big toes...

uh, he has six.

He is the new royal fry cook
and you...

Silence!

Is it hot in here, or what?

[gasps]

Patrick!

You hurt my friend!

You're not a king.

You're a bully and a liar!

So, little one...

You think you have
what it takes to be my fry cook.

I will prove your worthlessness.

You shall be tested
with a challenge!

Bring it on!

SpongeBob can handle any...

Ouch!

Your friend's arrogance
will cost you dearly.

There will be two challenges!

Only two?

What are two challenges
to someone like SpongeBob?

Three challenges!

Three?

[laughing]

Three challenges are nothing.

Might as well be 500 challenges!

Enough!

He'll settle for one.

There will be
but one challenge,

you will face me

in...

the ultimate cookoff!

I will accept your challenge
if you fix my friend.

Ah, yes...

the round one.

I shall restore him.

SpongeBob? SpongeBob?

SpongeBob!

Oh, there you are.

How you feeling?
Pretty good.

Say, have you gotten taller?

And now...

see the fate that may lie ahead.

For, if by some minute chance,
you meet the challenge

your reward will be great.

Behold!

[screaming]

Woopsie!

Now behold

my beloved home of Atlantis.

A prize worthy of Apollo.

You will reside here
in this glorious place

cook only for me

and be a god!

Hey, that sounds pretty good.

But if you
should not succeed...

you must give up fry cooking...

forever.

What do you say?

I'm ready!

Very well, then!

To the Poseidome!

Ladies and gentlemen

welcome
to the ultimate cookoff!

[cheering and whistling]

All right, mates first
to a thousand patties wins.

Shake hands.

[rumbling]

May the best man win.

Go back to your corners
and when the bell sounds,

come out cooking!

Don't worry, lad.

I have total confidence in you.

Put it all on Neptune!

I'm not good enough
to cook in Atlantis, Patrick.

I never should have taken
the challenge.

Don't give up your dream,
SpongeBob.

People used to tell me,

"Patrick, you'll never amount
to anything.

You'll always have your head
in the clouds."

But just look at me now.

[bell dings]
Go get 'em, tiger!

[rumbling]

[laughing]

"Once upon a time..."

[laughing]

Perfect.

I win!

[whooping]

[laughing]

Loser!

[laughing]

Free patties for everyone!

[cheering and applause]

[all cheering]

Fools!
Have you no taste buds?

There's nothing wrong
with these.

They're delicious!

Too chicken
to eat his own burger!

Why don't you eat it?

[chanting]
Try it.

Eat it! Eat it!

Okay, mine's no good.

But what makes you think
his will be any better?

Give me that!

Mmm!

Why, it tastes so good,

I think I'd like
to try it a second time.

[all groaning]

So, uh...

what do you think?

Yours is superior.

Therefore, I concede to you

SpongeBob SquarePants, you win.

[cheering]

Yay!
Yay!

We're going to Atlantis!
We're going to Atlantis!

[Neptune laughing]

What's so funny?

You, SpongeBob.

That repulsive thing
in my palace?

You mean Patrick can't come?

[laughing]

Oh, of course not.

And my friends...

Ah, the only friend
you'll need,

my dear boy is the royal grill.

It was nice knowing you, buddy.

[wailing]

I know, Mr. Krabs.

I'll miss you, too.

I lost me bet!

[crying]

Come, SpongeBob,
grab your things.

It's time to depart...

to Atlantis!

[crowd cheering]

I... I...

[sobbing]

I don't want to go!

It's too late now.

I can't live
without your burgers.

You're going to be a god
and like it!

Maybe we do have a problem.

Wait, Neptune!

I have another idea.

Good morning, Krusty crew.

Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?

Uh...

[Neptune hollers]

Can you excuse me?

The accursed stove
has burnt my finger.

Feel thine own wrath, stove!

[rumbling]
Haha!

What did I tell you about
using your powers, trainee?

Perfect patties are made
with love, not magic.
Are you ready, kids?

Aye aye, captain!

I can't hear you!

Aye aye, captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he

SpongeBob SquarePants!

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Ready?

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[laughs heartily]

[plays airy tune]

Fishermen have quite an effect
on our undersea friends.

SpongeBob, have you finished
swabbing the deck?

Almost.

There's a nasty barnacle
under table nine.

They're back!
They're back, I tell you!

I saw with my own eyes!

[all muttering]

The hooks!

The hooks!

How about a mint?

The hooks! The hooks!

Can you make that to go?

You don't know
how lucky you are.

The hooks!

So there I was,
minding my own business...

I'd love to hear another
of your riveting sea tales,

but, um...

I have to do
my wastebasket inspections.

Uhhuh... Mmhmm...

Oh, yeah, there's one.

Fine!
Don't say I didn't warn you.

Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?

The hooks, me bucko.

They're back.

Beware the hooks.

The hooks?
Aye, the hooks.

They dangle down

and draw you close
with their pleasing shapes

and their beguiling colors.

And just when you think

you found the land of milk
and honey,

they grab you by the britches

and haul you way up high!

Then higher,
and higher, and higher

until you're hauled up
to the surface

flopping and gasping for breath.

And then they cook you
and then they eat you!

Or worse...

What could be worse than that?

Gift shops.

[gasps]

Don't let it get me, Mr. Krabs.

There, there, boy,
they won't get you.

Not as long as you listen
to old Mr. Krabs.

Now get back to the kitchen!
Time is money.

Ayeaye, Mr. Krabs!

Good morning, Krusty crew!

Hey, Patrick.
Guess what?

The carnival's in town.

Come on, let's go.

I can't leave now, I'm working.

It's not leaving,
you're just taking a break.

We're going to the carnival,
going to the carniv...

oof!

We're going to the carnival,
going to the carnival.

There it is, SpongeBob.

The carnival is back in town!

I'm going to be first
in line for everything!

Where is everybody?

I don't know.

There was one kid here earlier.

Doesn't look like
any carnival I ever...

Oh! Excuse me.

[gasps]

Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it.

This isn't the carnival,
Patrick.

Those are hooks!

Mr. Krabs says
they're really dangerous!

Hmm...

I sense no danger here.

How could they be dangerous?

They're covered
with free cheese!

All I know is,
Mr. Krabs said...

Patrick! Don't do that!

Mmm... Cheesy.

No danger here.

Go on, try it.

But Mr. Krabs said...

SpongeBob,
let me ask you something.

Does this look dangerous?

[screams]
Ah... Patrick! Don't!

Lighten up, will you?

Or do I have to eat
all this cheese by mysel...

Whoa, ho, ho...!

[gasps]
Patrick!

Help! Oh, Patrick! Help!

Oh, Patrick, come back!

Oh, my best friend!

[laughing]

[crying]

[grunts]

Patrick, you're alive!

Am I ever!

You should try it.

But what about the surface...

and your britches...

and the gift shops?

You just jump off

before you go up too high.

Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get
near those things.

Did he say you shouldn't climb
on top of them

and ride them like a horsy?

Well, no.

Whee...

I guess he didn't!

[both laughing]

Hiho, silverfish!

Away!

[laughing]

Ready?

Ready.

Geronimo!

[laughing and whooping]

This is more fun
than double overtime

at the Krusty Krab!

P.U.! You call this food?

My sandwich tastes
like a fried boot.

My sandwich is a fried boot!

Hurry it up, will you!

We're hungry over here,
look at us!

[customers muttering angrily]

That's not how you're supposed
to flip it!

[all talking at once]

Why do you want
to eat this stuff anyway?

Mr. Squidward!

What the halibut's
going on in here?

It's a feeding frenzy, sir,

and SpongeBob's not back
from his break.

[laughing]

What?

I thought you said SpongeBob
was taking a break.

No one's taken a break
at the Krusty Krab

since the chum famine of '59.

[laughs]

Now, what were you saying?

He took... a break.

All right, SpongeBob lazypants,

I'll find you.

This nose can smell laziness
for up to 10,000 leagues.

Aha!

I'll give you a break
you'll not soon forget.

But Mr. Krabs,
I still need help...!

[sniffing]

They should be right here.

[both laughing]

Again?
Again!

The hooks! No, no, no!

One, two, three...

Wait, wait!

Oof!

Boys!

I wasn't quick enough.

They're gone!

If I could only hold him
in me arms again,

I, I'd...

[laughing]

I'd throttle them!

What did I tell you
about those hooks, boy?

I, uh, I...

I'll tell you about the hooks.

You ride them up
and up and up...

then you gently float down.

And do you know what happens

when you don't float back down?

Gift shop?
Worse!

You end up vacuumpacked...

in a can of tuna!

With nothing to look forward to
but the smell of mayonnaise!

[scream]
Aah!

We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.

I want you boys to promise me

you'll never go
on those hooks again.

We promise, Mr. Krabs.

I need a sailor's promise!

Repeat after me.

Yoho, yoho,
near the hooks I'll never go.

Yoho, yoho,
near the hooks we'll never go.

Aah!

Mother of pearl!

Fire on the poop deck!

Aah! Mother of pearl!

Fire on the poop deck!

Well... Whew!

All right, then.

Let's get out of this deathtrap
anyway.

Okay, Gary, today is a new day.

I'm ready to prove myself loyal
to Mr. Krabs.

[Gary meows]
I'm ready!

I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready, I'm ready

I'm ready, ready, ready,
I'm ready...

Hey, SpongeBob!

You're going the wrong way!

[grunts]

I always go to work this way.

You're not going to work today.

We're going to go play...

hooky!

But, Patrick, we promised.

I had my fingers crossed.

You don't have fingers,
Patrick.

Well, that Mr. Krabs
is just a big dummy.

We played on those hooks
all day long

and nothing happened to us.

But Mr. Krabs said...

Look, SpongeBob.

Are you going to listen
to a big dummy

or are you going to listen
to me?

Um...

See you later, SpongeBob.

I'm going to go have some fun.

Whoohoo!

Come on, SpongeBob!

Whoohoo!

You know you want to...

Oh...

I know I want to

but I promised Mr. Krabs

I wouldn't go near another...

Aah, hook!

Oh, no.

Mr. Krabs told me all about you.

You are a liar, a deceiver!

I'll never fall
for your tricks again!

Never!

Is this seat taken?

Whoo...

[laughing]

[giggling]

Hoo, glad I got that
out of my system.

[gasps]

I'm... hooked.

And that means...

[screams]

Help! I'm hooked! Help!

Mr. Krabs, help!

It happened! I'm hooked!

Oh, no, the hook, the hook!

Gift shop! Tuna can!

Mayonnaise!

Here you go, Pearl.

Free water
for all your little friends.

Thanks, dad.

Just don't forget
to leave a tip

for old Mr. Krabs.

Psst! Mr. Krabs...

SpongeBob!

You're two minutes late!

What kept you, laddie?

Um, you know those hooks
we were talking about yesterday?

Didn't I tell you
not to go near those hooks?

Um...

No. Er...!

I mean yes, yes,
you told me not to go near them!

Well, you weren't playing
on those hooks,

were you, laddie?

Of course not...

Er, I mean, not exactly.

Er, I mean, yes!

Yes, I did it! I admit it!

[crying]

Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm so ashamed!

I mean, look at me!

I'm hooked...!

Hmm, it's in there pretty deep.

What am I going to do?

There's only one thing to do,
boy.

[all laughing]

Oh, no, Mr. Krabs.

I can't take off my pants.

Not in front of all these...

girls.

[reeling]
[gasps]

Oh, okay, I'm taking them off,
I'm taking them off.

There.

Uh, lad.

[girls laughing]

[screams]

Oh, no. Oh, no.

No, no, no, Mr. Krabs,
I can't do it!

Anything but that.

I understand.

You were a good little fry cook,
SpongeBob.

[gasps]

But we'll find another.

Hopefully, one that will listen
to old Mr. Krabs.

Oh, Mr. Krabs,
I'll listen, I promise!

Whoa, whoa...!
Please save me, Mr. Krabs!

[crying]

I promise I'll be good!

Hoo!

[grunts]

Oh, look...

[giggling]

It's SpongeBob nudiepants.

[screams]

[all laughing]

Well,
that was more of SpongeBob

than I needed to see.

Mr. Squidward,

that was some fine angling.

Do you think
the lad has learned his lesson?

Oh, I think he'll remember this
for a long time.

I know I will.
The pants!

The underwear!

[both laughing]

Hello?

Does somebody have a can opener?

Ah...

Saturday morning
in bikini bottom.

SpongeBob is watching
his favorite

Saturday morning show

the adventures of Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy.

Enjoying a bowl of Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy bran cereal.

And wearing the official
Mermaidman and Barnacleboy

breakfast biters.

[show theme playing]

Mermaidman,
fleet and forceful...

by the power of Neptune!

Aided by his young ward...

aided by his young ward...

[grunts]

Protecting the sea

with feats of strength
and agility...

[both grunting]

[crack]

To the chiropractor!

Away...!

Fighting a rogues
gallery of villains

like the sinister slug...

The atomic flounder...

and the dreaded jumbo shrimp!

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy
unite!

Hey, kids, are you ready to hear

the winner
of this week's contest?

I'm ready! I'm ready!

Our winner will receive

a special
secret collector's item

from the adventures
of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy!

And the winner is...

Springboob Squirepin...

Aw...

I worked forever
on those lifesize crabby patty

mannequins
of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy.

..for these lifesize
crabby patty

mannequins
of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy!

Hey!

Springboob Squirepin
stole my idea!

[talking rapidly]

What's that? Oh...

it appears I've made
a slight error in pronunciation.

The real name
of the winner is...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

Wahoo!

Oh, I wonder when
my prize will...

get here... my prize!

[crying, blowing nose]

[laughing]

[gasps]

Can it be?

It is!

The conch signal!

From the adventures
of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy.

As seen on TV!

I wonder if it still works?

[inhales deeply]

[blows weak sour note]

[note echoing]

The conch signal!

To the invisible boatmobile!

[grunting and groaning]

Uh, Mermaidman?

Yes, Barnacleboy?

We're not
in the invisible boatmobile,

are we?

Uh, nope.

[both grunt]

I told you

making the boatmobile invisible
was a stupid idea.

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

It's got to be here
somewhere...

Ohh!

Oh, Mermaidman, I think I...

Found it!

Come on, get a move on, son.

We don't have all day.

Ignition... on!

Rocket on!

[engine roaring]

Hmm...

maybe the conch signal
doesn't work anymore.

[meows]

[engine roaring,
tires squealing]

[cat screeching]

And today torpedo mode!

Fire!

Mermaidman!

[dazed]

And bobicle bob...

I can't believe it, Gary.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy
in our home!

[meows]

Excuse me, I'm...

Oh, my Neptune!

He's been horribly disfigured!

Oh, blast us!

We're too late!

Oh, please.

He's not disfigured he's, he's,
just that sponge kid again.

Oh, yeah.

Good to see you, lad!

Say, Barnacleboy,
we've got to find out

where that conch signal
came from.

Oh, that was me.

I blew the conch signal, sir.

All right.

Where's the danger, son?

Bring it on.

Bring it on!

Don't worry.
There's no danger.

No danger?!
No danger?!

Look, there has to be danger.

You blew the conch signal,
and when you blow...

Where did you
get that thing anyway?

I won it in a contest.

Contest?
Contest?

They don't tell us
anything anymore!

Look, Spongy,
that ain't no toy.

That's right

The conch signal
is an awesome responsibility.

We're dutybound to help
whenever it sounds.

But you only blow it
when there's trouble

or there will be trouble,
you got that?

Yes, sirs!

Good boy!

[click tongues]

Come on, come on, come on.

They're serving meat loaf today.

Oh, goody!

Don't worry, Mermaidman.

You won't be hearing
from me for just anything.

Only for the big emergencies!

Will you hurry up in there?

And save me some hot wa...

[conch signal blowing]

The conch signal!

Come, young ward!

[groans]

[grunting and groaning]

[tires squeal, cat screeches]

Oh...

youth!

Cut down in its prime!

[groaning]

Oh, speak to me, son.

Help... Can't...

Open mayonnaise.

What?!

I come down here in my underwear
to open a jar of mayonnaise?!

But...
But nothing!

We can't go around socializing.

We have to be prepared for,
uh...

emergencies!

Barnacleboy, think about it.

Emergencies don't come around
as often as they used to.

All right, okay.

You can blow the conch
every once in a while,

just give us something to do
when we show up!

Yay!
Yay!

[conch signal blowing]

Danger!

[no dialogue]

All right, that's it!

Give me that!

You're running us ragged.

Must...

must answer the clarion call!

[groans]

We're exhausted!

I'm sorry, Barnacleboy.

I didn't mean it, I...

just wanted
to spend time with you.

You're my heroes!

It's too late for that,
Mr. Contest winner.

I'm going to destroy
this thing with my...

sulfur vision!

[grunting]

[groans]

[grunting]

[groans]

Well, I'll destroy it

when I get back
to the, uh, mermalair.

And as for you...

Barnacleboy...

don't squash his enthusiasm.

After all, he could be the hero
of tomorrow or the villain.

Besides...

I remember
another young whippersnapper

who wanted to be a superhero.

You don't
even remember breakfast,

you old coot.

[crying]

Maybe the conch signal
is too much responsibility.

But how would you like to spend
the rest of the afternoon...

on patrol?

What?!

To the invisible boatmobile!

Oh...

Jingle bells

Mermaidman smells,
Barnacleboy laid an egg

The invisible boatmobile
lost a wheel and...

Hey, can I drive?

Drive?

What do you know about driving
the invisible boatmobile?

Tons!

Like the windshield wipers
are right here.

Don't touch that button!
It's the...

[grunting and groaning]

..origami button.

When
you're patrolling the city,

you always have to be vigilant.

On your toes, constantly alert.

Always expect the unexpected.

[both gasp]

[screaming]

I've got the donuts!

And Barnacle Boy
laid an egg, hey, hey!

Oh, that fellow over there
used to be the atomic flounder.

I know he doesn't look like much
but he could go back to crime...

just like that.

[both laugh]

Help! Help!

Help, somebody there!

You're under arrest,
atomic flounder!

You stop, kid, stop!

Let him go!

You said he could snap...

just like that.

What?!

Get off of me!

If I weren't retired, I, I'd...

[roaring]

Do that.

Out of my way, punk!

I can't believe it!

I rode
in the invisible boatmobile

met a villain and learned
to treat thirddegree burns,

all in one day.

So what
are we gonna do tomorrow?

Uh...

say, kid, why don't you
take this nickel

and go over there and see

if our theme song
is on the jukebox?

Okay.

You know,
for a pain in the neck

he's a pretty nice kid.

Let's ditch him.

Right behind you.

It doesn't seem to be here.

Oh, it's there, all right.

Keep looking.

Diligence, diligence.

Ayeaye, sir!

[both chuckling]

Dagnabbit!

What's the matter?

Where did we park
the invisible boatmobile?

Aw, that's the 15th time
I've looked.

But I can't let my heroes down!

Boatmobile?

Where are you?

Barnacleboy, I found it!

[starts engine]

[sizzling]

[menacing laughter]

Still getting burned
on that tailpipe,

huh, Barnacleboy?

[laughing]

It's the dirty bubble!

In all his dirty roundness!

Oh, no!
Oh, no!

I found it!

And it's the special dance mix.

Help! Help!

[dirty bubble laughing]

Help! Help!

Holy crabby patties!

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy's
archnemesis!

The dirty bubble!

I can't believe it!

[laughing]

You cannot save them,
sponge of mystery!

They are trapped
by my awesome surface tension!

[laughs]

You don't understand!

You're my most favorite
supervillain!

Can I have your autograph?

Oh, no. Oh!

Oh, no, you fool!

Stay back! The point!

Ooh, ooh, ooh!

Watch the point!

Aah!

[Mermaidman laughs]

You saved us, son!

Yeah, you're, you're a hero!

I am?

Are you up for another ride
in the invisible boatmobile?

Oh...

Jingle bells,
Mermaidman smells

Barnacleboy laid an egg

The dirty bubble popped

And Mermaidman and Barnacleboy
and SpongeBob got away!

Yay!

Watch out.
Are you ready, kids?

Kids: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

[ louder]: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish.

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Ready?
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[ laughs heartily]

[ plays airy tune][Captioning sponsored by THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

and NICKELODEON]

[ gogo music playing on TV]

[ meows]

Gary!

Uh, uh, I was just looking

for the sports channel, Gary.

[ knock on door]

Come in!

Hey, SpongeBob,
want to see my new shoes?

Those are
great, Patrick!

Let's see what they
look like on your feet.

Uh... wouldn't you rather
see them on... my hands?

Okay...

And we can wear gloves
on our feet

and hats on our
captain's quarters, too.

Uh, actually...

I have a confession
to make.

I don't know
how to tie my shoelaces.

[ laughs]

Do you know how lucky you are

to have a friend like me?

Yes...

Look at this knot.

Have you ever seen
a more perfectly executed

shoefastening bow?

Gosh... probably not.

I learned when I was
just a boy, Patrick

and I'm willing to
pass on what I know.

Go sit over there

and let an old pro
show you how to do it.

Pay close attention,
Patrick.

Well, you start by taking
one lace per hand...

and then you...

uh... you got to...

loop the, the...

Are you sure you know
how to do it?

Patrick, please, shoetying
requires peace and quiet.

Okay, where was I?

Your shoes are
still untied.

Well, I guess you don't want me
to show you how to do it.

I'm sorry!
I won't interrupt anymore!

I've got it!

The first rule of shoetying is

"always start
with your right foot."

Now the lesson
will officially begin.

[ laughs nervously]

That's... not right.

[ laughs nervously]

Get it?

Not... right... hmm...

No.

Okay, no more
fooling around.

I got it!

[ laughs nervously]

What was that?

Are you okay?

Aren't you
late for something?

The poop deck,
you're right!

We'll have to do
this lesson later!

Bye, SpongeBob!

I can't believe I've forgotten
how to tie my own shoes.

They've been tied
for as long as I can remember.

Well, I'll remember
after a good night's sleep.

[ crickets chirping]

[ rooster crows]

[ snoring]

[ foghorn blows]

Oh...

No big deal.

I'll remember sooner or later.

'Cause I'm ready!

I'm...

read... y.

I'm read... ooh!

I'm read... uh!

I'm read... ooy!

I'm read... doy!
I'm read... doy!

I'm read... duh!

I'm read... doy!

I'm read... doy!
I'm read... doy!

I'm read... doy!
I'm read... duh!

I'm read... doy!
I'm read... duh!

I'm read... doy!

Hi, SpongeBob.

[ gasps]
Oh, no!

I can't let Patrick see

I still haven't tied my shoes!

[ loud crashes]

Hey, SpongeBob...

you're shorter.

Have you been dieting?

Well, a sponge has to
look his spongiest.

Well, I got to get to work.

[ cracking]

[ grunting]

Oh, barnacles!

Maybe I should just lay here.

Those patties
aren't going to

cook themselves,
SpongeBob.

He's right!

Got to make Krabby Patties!

Laces or no laces!

[ grunting...]

Ah... I just have to stand
in this one spot.

Tada! A perfect patty.

All right, SpongeBob,
hand it over.

Well?

[ gulps]

[ gasps]

[ grunting...]

Hey, Squidward,
I've got an idea.

How about
you come get it?

Oh, gee, SpongeBob,
that's a great idea.

And maybe I should
cook the patties

and do the dishes

and wear square pants

and live in a pineapple

while you wait in the
unemployment line!

No!

Then bring that patty here

now!

Okay, Squidward.

Here I come.

I'm coming over.

I'm bringing the patty to you.

Here comes the patty.

No problem.

I'm walking...
the Krabby Patty...

over to Squidward.

All right, Squidward.

I'm giving you the patty...

for the hungry customer...

so they can eat it...

when I give it to you...

which is right... now.

Uh, SpongeBob?

I'm over here!

Now move!

Okay, Squidward.

Just slowly move your leg.

Walk over there...

with the... dah!

SpongeBob!

I'm sorry, Squidward.

Sponge... Bob...

I'll just make another... doy!

Sponge...!

Hold it... doy!

Let me just... duh!

Hold it... sorry, Squid.

Sorry... Oh...

[ grunting and gulping]

What's the holdup?

[ loud burp]

I think my heart just stopped.

[ all yelling angrily]

It's Sponge...
[ loud burp]...
Bob's fault.

SpongeBob's fault...
SpongeBob's fault...

[ sniffling]

I failed.

My career is over.

I'm sorry, spatula.

I'm sorry, hat.

I'm sorry, floor.

I am sorry, Krabby Patties.

[ crying]

Let's see, a fiveletter word
for happiness.

"Money." [ laughs]

This is the
worst service
we've ever had.

We're going to
the Chum Bucket!

Wait!

Wait!

Don't go!

Oh, yeah, we are
definitely out of here.

[ all yelling angrily]

Wait, don't go!

That's me money
walking out the door!

What's the meaning
of this, Mr. Squidward?

It's SpongeBob's
fault.

Arr... SpongeBob, get out here!

More...

More...

All the way, boy!

What be the matter,
SpongeBob?

I ought to make you
walk the plank for this.

I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs,
it's just that I...

I...

Yes?

I... I... I, I, I, I...

Yes, yes, yes?

I, I, I...

Out with it, boy!
What is it?

I forgot how to tie
my shoes.

[ laughs]

That's all?

So you'll show me how?

I don't wear shoes.

[ gasps]

Could you show me

how to tie my shoes?

Uh, fins?

Could you show me
how to tie my shoes?

Well, I would, but, sadly,
I am only an eel.

[ panting]

Could any of you show me
how to tie my laces?

Could you, you, you, you, you or
you show me how to tie a knot?

Could you show me how
to tie a simple knot?

[ roars]

Could you show me
how to tie my shoes?

Could you show me
how to tie my shoes?

Arr... I be just
a painting of a head.

Doesn't anybody know
how to tie a knot...?!

[ thunder booms]

[ evil laughter]

Did somebody say knot?

I did.

So, you want to tie knots,
do ya?

Well, do ya?!

Yes, please,
Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir.

Then you've come to
the right flying ghost, kid.

You're looking at
the first place winner

in the fancy knotting contest
for the last 3,000 years!

Hooray!

You're gonna have to
not do that.

And stop staring at me
with them big old eyes.

Now, stand back and
watch me be knotty.

[ laughs]

[ laughs]

Behold! The pretzel knot!

Ooh...

The double diamond knot!

The square knot!

The constrictor!

The gut knot!

The pillow knot!

[ snoring]

The butterfly knot.

Ooh...

Wait, there's more!

The monkey chain!

The monkey's fist!

The monkey!

[ hooting]

This one here's a loop knot

otherwise known as the...
poop loop.

Poop?

[ laughs]

Those are great,
Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir.

Now can you show me
how to tie my shoes?

[ laughs]

I don't know
how to tie me shoes.

I haven't worn shoes
for over 5,000 years!

But sometimes I like
to wear this little sock

over me ghostly tail.

[ laughing, thunder booming]

[ groaning]

[ meows]

Not now, Gary.

[ meows]

I'm not
in the mood, Gary.

[ meows]

Just leave me and
my untied shoes alone, Gary.

[ roars]

Okay, Gary,
you have my attention.

[ meows]

[ wet slapping]

[ gasps]

Gary!

Well, I'll be!

You can tie shoes!

Hopping clams!

How did you learn
how to do that?

[ music playing]

Want to learn
how to tie your shoe?

It's a very easy thing to do

You sit on down
and I'll give you the scoop

What's that?

It's called
the loopdeeloop

You got to take a lace
in each hand

You go over and under again

You make a loopdeeloop
and pull

and your shoes
are looking cool

You go over and back,
left to right

Loopdeeloop
and you pull them tight

Like bunny ears
or a Christmas bow

Lace 'em up
and you're ready to go

You make a loopdeeloop
and pull

and your shoes
are looking cool

[ music continues]

You make a loopdeeloop
and pull

and your shoes
are looking cool.

NARRATOR:
Ah, beautiful springtime.

A time of fun and frolic
for most...

but not for this poor slob.

Oh, what
a beautiful day.

And here I am

trapped in a prison
of high cholesterol.

[ bell dings]

Oh! No one ever comes in
on Sunday.

[ bell dings]

Oh! Why can't Mr. Krabs
just let us go home?

[ bell dings]

Oh...!

[ dings]

[ giggling]

SpongeBob, stop ringing
this bell.

I was just testing it.

I will ring the bell
when there's an order.

But...

there's no customers!

There hasn't been one all day
and there isn't going to be any!

Ooh...!
[ bell dings]

One Krabby Patty coming up!

No... oof!

[ clattering]

That sounds like
me money dropping.

What's going on
out here?!

My babies!

Get away, barbarian!

What have you done?

Nice clean money... soiled!

I'll take care of you.

Papa clean you up.

Clear the way!

No, no, no,
don't cry, little ones.

What's wrong,
Mr. Krabs?

Me dime!

Oh...

No...!

I got it, boy.

What the...?

It's stuck!

You got to help me,
SpongeBob!

You've got to let go
of the dime.

I can think
of ten good reasons

to never let go
of a dime, boy.

There's got to be
another way!

Grab me captain's
quarters and heave!

[ both grunting]

[ grunting]

Me arms...!

Oh, no, not again!

[ grunts]

[ clanging and grunting]

[ groans]

[ clink]

[ groans]

Wait...

Squidward...

I'm putting you
in charge

of things around here
while I'm gone.

You can count on me, sir!

Take care, hurry back.

Get well soon.

You're in our thoughts.

Takes more muscles to
frown than to smile.

Okay, SpongeBob,
let's get down to business.

My first official act
as new manager

is to give you
a promotion.

Oh! Really?

You get to run
the cash register.

The cash register...?

Wow!

Squidward, who's going to
work the grill?

You areit's part
of the promotion
I mentioned earlier.

You'll be wearing
two hats now.

You're going to
take the orders

then you're going to
make them!

Oh...

This is the best day of my life.

Me, too.

But wait, if I'm running
the register and the grill

what are you going to do?

I've got some
very important

bosslike
errands to run.

See you later.

Squidward!

What?

You forgot

to teach me how to use...

the cash register...

You push the button
and put the money inside.

Okay, you're on your own.

I can't believe
this is really happening.

Today I start living!

Well, Squidward, you've really
outdone yourself this time.

A beautiful day of relaxing
and pampering... with pay.

Hmm... guess I do feel
kind of bad

for poor little SpongeBob

all by his lonesome...

Oh, oh, it will pass.

He's probably just
standing at the register

with that stupid grin
on his face.

Hey, SpongeBob!

Hey, Patrick!

Hey, SpongeBob

could you give me
change for a quarter?

No problem!

Here you go!

Thanks!

I forgot to tell him

how to make change! Oh...!

Sponge...

Bob...

Hmm... Phew.

Hi, Squidward.
All done with those errands?

No, I am not.

I just remembered

I needed change
for this dollar.

Do you want four quarters

or ten dimes, or 20 nickels,
or 100 pennies

or one quarter, three dimes,
seven nickels and ten pennies

or, if you give me a fivedollar
bill, your options are...

All right! Goodbye.

This is great.

My day off, no worries,
just relaxation.

I'm the boss, I deserve this.

Ah...

[ thinking]: 
Everything will be fine.

There won't be 
any customers today anyway.

He'll probably just 
stand there bored.[ chuckles]

SpongeBob, bored.[ chuckles]

Uh... getting kind of bored.

Ah... [ snoring]

Aah, ooh!

[ puffing]

[ gibbering]

Oh, what am I doing?

I am wasting valuable relaxing
time, that's what I'm doing!

I mean, really,
what are the odds?

SpongeBob setting
the Krusty Krab on fire?

[ laughs]

[ siren wailing]

Aah!

[ panting...]

May I help you, sir?

It's me, you dunce!

Oh, hi, Squidward!

How are those errands going?

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm very busy.

I'm sure you are.

I don't like your tone.

[ higherpitched]:
I'm sure you are.

[ normal voice]:
How's that?

Just do your jobs!

Ayeaye, Mr. Tentacles.

[ muttering]

Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs
put him in charge.

Must... re... lax!

[ sighs]

Look at yourself.

You're losing your bluish glow.

Stop worrying so much.

Now, repeat after me.

You will not go back
to the Krusty Krab.

I will destroy the Krusty Krab!

Aah!

SpongeBob!

Have you finished...?

No!

That's it!

No matter what sick fantasies
run through my mind

I will not go back
to that restaurant!

[ panting]

Have you finished those errands?

[ panting]

[ panting]

Have you finished those errands?

[ panting]

Have you finished 
those errands?

[ panting]

Have you finished those errands?

[ panting]

Have you finished

those errands?

Have you finished 
those errands?

Have you finished 
those errands?

Have you finished 
those errands?

Errands, errands...

Errands, errands, errands...

Have you finished those errands?

Have you finished those errands?

Have you finished those errands?

No, I am not finished
with those errands

and I never will be,
so quit checking up on me!

I know what you're up to.

Forcing me to come back here
every time you mess up!

But I haven't...

Maybe you haven't

messed up yet

but you will.

You will...

And when you do,
I'll be there.

I'll be there!

[ laughing wildly]

Gosh, Squidward
sure is a hard worker.

He makes me proud
to wear these hats.

There! Now I'll have to stay
here and enjoy myself!

[ laughs]

I'm not even going to think
about youknowwho

at the youknowwhat
doing Idon'tcare.

[ laughs]

Just gonna... relax.

Let Squid's day off... begin.

[ SpongeBob laughing]

What was that?

[ SpongeBob laughing]

It's SpongeBob.

He's spying on me to see if I'm
really doing errands. [ laughs]

But he left his post.
[ laughs]

And I've finally caught him
messing up. [ laughs]

Aha! I caught you, Sponge...

Branch.

[ scratches like 
SpongeBob laughing]

Ha... here's the rubber duck
Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.

I got you now!

Wait till Mr. Krabs
finds out you're a... toilet.

You're losing it, Squidward.

Calm down.

If I let this get to me again

I'll just end up running down
to the Krusty Krab

bursting through the front door

up to that yellow headache,
SpongeBob, and he'll say...

Hi, Squidward.

Are you finished with
those errands yet?

Aha!

I know you're in here.

[ gasps]

He's headed back
to the Krusty Krab!

I'll beat him there!

[ panting]

I've got you now, SpongeBob!

Hey, put
some clothes on!

The truth will be revealed!

Whoaho,
right on, Squidward!

Okay, Mr. Krabs.

Get plenty of rest

and if things
don't seem right,
come back.

Thanks, Doc.

[ laughing wildly]

SpongeBob, you can't...

[ laughing wildly]

Aha!

I caught you now!

You didn't think I knew

you were a stick
outside my window! Ha!

Or the toilet in my bathroom!

And then you were
in my bathtub, and I...

and you... and I...

and then you... swam...
down the drain...

and... beat me
to the Krusty Krab.

Uh, does that
mean you're...?

Yes, SpongeBob.

I am finished
with those errands.

I guess I want to take
my place back

at the cash register.

I really do.

Then you might want to
put these on.

Hmm...

Hey, Squidward, you know what?

Look, we forgot to switch
the "Closed" sign to "Open."

It's almost like we could have
taken the whole day off!

YOUR BREATH STINKS.

REALLY BAD.

OH...

OH, BARNACLE!

PATRICK, WHAT DID YOU EAT?

OH, SOME ROAST BEEF,
SOME CHICKEN, A PIZZA.

NO, I MEANT JUST THIS MORNING.

SOME ROAST BEEF,

WHAT ELSE?

WELL, I HAD

That will be all.

I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT.

OOH, HOORAY!

THE NEW SPATULAS
ARE HERE!

SIT DOWN,
BOY!

THERE'S NO NEW SPATULAS.

HOW DISAPPOINTING.

YOU MEN KNOW
ME DAUGHTER PEARL.

SHE'S GROWING UP FAST.

IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS
JUST YESTERDAY

I WAS TEACHING HER
HOW TO BREACH.

ME MAMMALIAN ANGEL.

UM... ANYWAY, UH

SO SHE'S GOING TO BE
WORKING HERE

DURING HER SUMMER VACATION.

SHE'S GOT A LOT
OF FRESH IDEAS

TO BRING IN
SOME HUNGRY CUSTOMERS.

[ bell dings]

Pearl:
HELLO! DADDY?

THAR SHE BLOWS!

SPONGEBOB, DO YOU
REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS?

NO NEW SPATULAS?

NO! IT MEANS
SOME BRATTY TEENAGER'S

COMING IN HERE
TO TELL US WHAT TO DO.

WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

WE HAVE SENIORITY, RIGHT?

RIGHT!

SO, WE'LL

WORK TOGETHER

TO PROTECT OUR
PATHETIC POSITIONS.

OKEYDOKEY,
SQUIDWARD.

AND THEN WE'LL GET
THOSE NEW SPATULAS.

ALL RIGHT, MEN.

SAY HELLO TO ME PEARL.

HELLO, POLE.

HI, GUYS.

IT MAKES ME
JOLLY AS A ROGER

TO FINALLY HAVE YOU

ABOARD
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

GREAT, DAD.

BECAUSE I HAVE
SO MANY NEW IDEAS.

[ sniffs]

I CAN SMELL THE MONEY ALREADY.

I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

IT'S A SURPRISE.

I LIKE SURPRISES.

CLOSE YOUR EYES.

I'M READY!

WELL, I LIKE IT SO FAR.

TADA!

[ gasps]

IT'S THE NEW
KRUSTY CREW UNIFORM.

I DESIGNED IT MYSELF.

OKAY, THIS IS IT,
SPONGEBOB.

NOW TELL HER
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL
ABOUT THAT UNIFORM.

OKAY, SQUIDWARD.

PEARL...

THIS IS THE GREATEST
UNIFORM EVER!

FISHPASTE!

OH, SPONGEBOB,
YOU LOOK SO ADORABLE.

I COULD JUST EAT YOU UP.

SORRY, PEARL, THIS ITEM'S
NOT ON THE MENU.

[ laughing]

WELL, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
POSSIBLE, SPONGEBOB

BUT YOU LOOK EVEN MORE
RIDICULOUS THAN USUAL.

DON'T BE JEALOUS,
UNCLE SQUIDDY.

I MADE ONE
FOR YOU, TOO.

DON'T BOTHER!

ONLY A FOOL
WOULD WEAR THAT.

AVAST YE, SHIPMATES!

DON'T THESE
JUST SHIVER YOUR TIMBERS?

[ laughing]

GET THAT SUIT ON,
SAILOR!

IT'S ALREADY BEEN
PAID FOR.

RAGE.

FURY.

IRRITATION.

HUMILIATION.

SQUIDWARD IS
SUCH A BARNACLE.

A STICK IN THE SAND.

BUT NOT YOU, SPONGEBOB.

YOU ARE FULL OF STYLE.

ME? REALLY?

TOTALLY, S.B.

YOU OOZE FASHION.

AND I'VE GOT
SOME COMPLETELY

CORAL CONCEPTS
FOR THIS OLD JOINT.

I'M GOING
TO NEED SOMEONE

WITH YOUR KIND OF
TALENT TO HELP ME.

WELL, I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET MR. KRABS

TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

WHY, WITH MY
GIRLISH INSTINCTS

AND YOUR, UM...
SPONGINESS.

WE'LL TURN THIS
WORNOUT LUNCH WAGON

INTO A TEENAGE
PARADISE.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT DO YOU
LIKE BETTER

THE KUTIE KRAB
OR THE KOOKY KRAB?

FOR WHAT, DARE I ASK?

THE NEW NAME
FOR OUR NEW LOOK.

I MEAN, "THE KRUSTY KRAB"
HAS GOT TO GO.

WHO WANTS TO EAT AT A PLACE
THEY THINK IS CRUSTY?

BLEH!

SURE, IT'S A TERRIBLE NAME

BUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE PLACE.

SO THE NAME SHOULD BE
LEFT ALONE.

RIGHT, SPONGEBOB?

I GOT IT!

HOW ABOUT
THE KHAOTIC KRAB?

HMM... HOW ABOUT THE KISSY KRAB?

[ kissing]

THE KING KRAB?

THE KANDY KRAB.

THE KOOL KRAB.

OR THE KOWBOY KRAB.

THE KURLY KRAB.

THE KREEPY KRAB.

SOLD THE KRUSTY KRAB.

THAT'S A DARN SHAME.

HEY, LADY!

DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE CAN GET

SOMETHING TO EAT
AROUND HERE?

THAT'S IT! I QUIT!

EE...

A COOL PLACE FOR TEENS

TO JUST,

WITH THE TIMES.

YOU'RE A TRUE
VISIONARY, PEARL.

THANK YOU,
SPONGEBOB.

I DO HAVE 2020 VISION.

WELL, HIP PEOPLE
HAVE TO EAT, TOO.

BACK TO THE GRILL.

THE CUSTOMERS MAY BE HOT,
BUT MY GRILL IS HOTTER.

HISS...

[ bell dings]

ORDER UP!

TWO... SALLADS.

NEVER HEARD OF IT.

I GOT TO STAY HIP.

I DON'T WANT TO END UP
LIKE SILLY OLD SQUIDWARD.

BUT WHAT IN THE NAME
OF DAVY JONES'S LOCKER

IS A SALLAD?

HERE YOU GO!

TWO SALADS!

EWW, GROSS!

THOSE AREN'T SALADS.

TAKE THOSE BACK.

REMOVE THE BUN,
THE PATTY

AND THE CONDIMENTS.

BUT THAT LEAVES
JUST LETTUCE AND TOMATO.

EXACTLY.

ALL RIGHT.

OKAY...

NO BUNS.

THAT'S HIP.

NO PATTIES.

HAPPENING!

OH, YEAH...

THAT'S DEFINITELY
THE COOLEST MEAL I EVER SAW.

THIS IS SO COOL...

TWO SALADS.

THAT WAS AWFUL.

I HOPE I NEVER
HAVE TO TEAR APART

A PERFECTLY GOOD CRABBY PATTY
EVER AGAIN.

I DON'T THINK MY HEART
CAN TAKE IT.

[ screams]

WHERE'S THE GRILL?

COME ON, SPONGEBOB.

YOU'RE A HIP GUY.

YOU KNOW FRIED FOODS
ARE OUT, OUT!

BUT... RIGHT ON.

CHECK OUT THIS NEW MENU
I CAME UP WITH.

SALAD AND TEA.

BUT WHERE ARE
THE CRABBY PATTIES?

OH, SILLY, THOSE AREN'T HIP.

OH, YOU WON'T BE NEEDING
THAT THING ANYMORE.

BUT, BUT, BUT...

I'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE FUN
FOR YOU TO DO ANYWAY.

HEY, BUDDY,
YOU NEED A RIDE?

I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE BIG DOOFUS CONVENTION.

[ laughs]

THIS IS HUMILIATING.

I'M A FRY COOK, DARN IT!

YOU CAN TAKE AWAY MY SPATULA

BUT WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY
MY DIGNITY

THAT'S WHEN I GET MAD!

I'M GOING TO MARCH
RIGHT INTO MR. KRABS'S OFFICE

AND TELL HIM
THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH.

[ grunts, groans]

[ whimpers, cries]

OKAY, SPONGEBOB.

YOU CAN DO THIS.

COME ON...

MR. KRABS, COULD I TALK TO YOU?

COME ON IN, ME BOY.

HAVE A SEAT.

THANKS, MR. KRABS.

[ chair squeaks]

DON'T YOU JUST LOVE
ME NEW OFFICE?

PEARLY DESIGNED IT FOR ME.

MR. KRABS, UM, I THINK
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

ISN'T THAT THE NEATEST
$40 CHAIR YOU EVER SAT IN?

[ muffled]:

SOME BAD NEWS.

HOW ABOUT MY CUDDLY
EXECUTIVE BUDDY?

REDUCES STRESS FOR ONLY
FIVE EASY PAYMENTS OF $9.95

MR. KRABS, PEARL IS

WHAT?! WHY, PEARL IS 
SAVINGTHE KRUSTY KRAB!

I MEAN, THE KUDDLY KRAB.

WHAT WOULD WE DO
WITHOUT THESE BEAUTIFUL

$20 SEA UNICORN
WALL HANGERS?

HOW COULD WE HAVE EVER SURVIVED
WITHOUT THESE $35 HEART LIGHTS?

HOW COULD WE GO ON WITHOUT
A SEA FERN ON EVERY LAST TABLE?!

IT'S HIP!

IT'S CORAL!

[ crying]:
IT'S LOSING MONEY!

OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, SPONGEBOB.

BUT I CAN'T FIRE
ME PRIDE AND JOY.

IT WOULD BREAK HER
FRAGILE LITTLE HEART.

WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

THERE, THERE,
MR. KRABS.

I'M SURE
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.

THAT'S IT, BOY!

WHAT'S IT?

YOU COULD FIRE HER.

IT'S OKAY
IF SHE HATES YOU.

THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID, SIR.

GREAT, THEN,
IT'S ALL SETTLED.

YOU FIRE PEARLY.

I'LL HIDE IN ME OFFICE.

OOF!

TOTALLY RUDE,
SPONGEBOB.

PEARL, COULD I SEE YOU
IN THE KITCHEN?

SURE, SPONGEBOB.

HOW AM I GOING TO 
BREAK IT TO HER?

I'VE NEVER FIRED ANYONE BEFORE.

I JUST GOT TO SAY IT.

PEARL, YOU'RE FIRED!

OKAY, HERE IT GOES.

[ inhales]

[ crying...]

SPONGEBOB!

[ exhales]

I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

NOTHING I DO IS WORKING.

SURE IT IS, PEARL.

LOOK AT ALL
THE HIP YOUNG PEOPLE

EATING SALADS.

NO, DON'T YOU GET IT?

I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET FIRED
SINCE DAY ONE.

I WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO LIKE
THIS PLACE TO PLEASE DADDY.

THIS JOB IS CUTTING MAJORLY
INTO MY SOCIAL LIFE.

OH, SPONGEBOB,
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

I'VE GOT IT!

I COULD PRETEND TO FIRE YOU.

I'LL TAKE THE HEAT
FROM OLD MAN KRABS LATER.

GOSH, YOU'D REALLY
DO THAT FOR ME?

YOU'RE A GREAT PAL,
SPONGEBOB.

HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU?

[ muffled]:
STOP TRYING TO
BREAK ME IN HALF?

DEAL.

OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

OKAY, PEARL...

WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS
CONVINCING.

PEARL, I NEED TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

OH, NO, HERE IT GOES.

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
BEAR TO LISTEN.

IT'S NOT THAT YOU
HAVEN'T DONE

A GOOD JOB
AROUND HERE...

OH! DON'T BE TOO HARD
ON HER NOW.

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?

IT'S FOR THE BEST.

WELL, WE FEEL
IT MIGHT BE

IN EVERYBODY'S
BEST INTEREST IF...

I CAN'T LET HIM DO THIS.

HUH?

GET ON WITH IT, SPONGEBOB!

PEARL, YOU'RE FIRED.

AAH! OOH!

[ whispers]:
THANKS, SPONGEBOB.

COME ON, GANG, THE MALL WAITS.

HEY, MR. KRABS, I DID IT!

[ screams]

OH, PEARLY...

[ sniffs]

IS THAT A $20?

OH, SPONGEBOB, HOW COULD WE
HAVE DONE SUCH A THING

TO ME OWN FLESH AND BLOOD?

THERE, THERE,
MR. KRABS.

PEARL TOOK IT
JUST FINE.

IN FACT, SHE SEEMED
KIND OF HAPPY.

REALLY?

SHE'S OFF TO BIGGER
AND BETTER THINGS.

THAT'S ME GIRL!

TOUGH AS NAILS,
JUST LIKE HER OLD MAN.

[ laughs]

BUT HOW AM I GOING
TO GET MY MONEY BACK

FOR ALL THIS STUFF?

HMM...

[ rock music playing]

HOO, YEAH!

[ laughing]

WHOOHOO!

ALL RIGHT!

ISN'T THIS GREAT, GARY?

AND IT ONLY COST ME
ONE YEAR'S SALARY.

Great, Patrick.

"For outstanding achievement

SpongeBob Squarepants?"

"SpongeBob Squarepants?"

That's a funny way

Patrick, I think
the award is for me.

You must have got it by mistake.

I can find it!

Is it in here?

No, that's my...

Patrick.

[ whistling]

[ ringing]

Man on phone:
Is this the Krusty Krab?

No, this
is Patrick!

I'm not
a krusty krab.

Uh, Patrick, that's
the name of the restaurant.

Huh?

PATRICK:
Fish paste!

It's a little dusty
around table three.

How about if you
sweep it out?

What's the point?

I can't
do anything right.

You'll do fine.

[ squeaking]

Hey, pal?

You just blow in
from Stupidtown?

Keep trying, Patrick!

I got a load
of awards

for SpongeBob
Squarepants.

[ steam whistle blowing]

Why can't I do anything right?!

[ customers coughing]

[ gasping]

Kitchen...

I'm never going
to get an award now.

Don't give up,
Patrick!

This time I've got something

I know you can do.

We'll open a jar.

[ pop]

Easy!

Now you try.

First, get a jar.

That's a pickle.

You need a jar.

No.

No.

No.

Try this.

Now, take the lid off the jar.

Just relax.

Lift your hand...

Great, we're
almost there.

Now put it
on the lid.

No, the lid.

The lid.

The lid.

The lid...

Freeze!

[ panting]

Almost there.

Now head
for the lid...

Hold.

Warmer.

Warmer!

Warmer!

You're hot,
you're on fire!

Ah, it burns!

Okay, okay, wait, wait!

Do exactly... as I do.

Exactly...

as I do.

Exactly...

[ pop]

Exactly... [ pop]

Exactly...
[ pop]

Exactly... as... you... do.

[ pop]

Oh, no, I broke it!

No, no, Patrick,
you did it!

I did?

[ cheering]

Touchdown!

I'm jarmaster!

That was great, Patrick!

You really
got the hang of it.

Yeah, remember
when I had my hand up

and I put it
on the lid?

Oh, yeah.

And then
I took the lid off

and I thought
I broke it?

Ah, yeah!

But I didn't!

I opened the jar
with my hand!

And it was all
because you showed me
how to do it.

I'm never
going to forget this.

Patrick, you do
exactly what I do

and you'll have
an award in no time.

[ rooster crowing]

I'm ready, I'm ready

I'm ready.

Good morning, SpongeBob.

Wow, it's amazing
how a simple change of clothes

can make a guy look...

just like me.

Yup, if I'm going
to be an award winner

I've got
to dress like one.

That's creepy.

But flattering.

I'm ready, I'm ready

I'm ready,
I'm ready

Both:
I'm ready...

I'm ready, I'm ready

I'm ready, I'm ready...

I'm ready...

Well, back to the old grind.

Well, back to the old grind.

Forgot my hat.

Me, too.

Whoa!

Ohhh!

Aha!

You're copying me!

Yes.

Why are you
doing that?

So I can win an award,
like you.

Well, it's annoying,
so stop it!

Stop it.

Say, you're good.

Thanks.

Ha!Ha!

Darn!Darn!

Mary had a little lambMary had a little lamb

At least I'm safe 
inside my mind.

At least I'm safe 
inside my mind.

Ahh!Ahh!

Stop copying me!

PATRICK:
There's no award
for that!

Well, I guess
it's safe to go in now.

[ panting]

Patrick, how long are you
going to keep this up?

Until I have
as many awards as you!

We'll see about that!

No, we won't!

I'm the jump rope champion
of Bikini Bottom.

[ panting]:
Me, too!

Oh, yeah?

I call this one
"the slice and dice."

Hanot a scratch on me!

[ mumbling]

Oh, no you don't!

Ugh!

[ gasping]

[ clanking][ clanking]

Not much fun
being me now,
huh, Patrick?

[ gasping]:
Are you kidding?

I used to do this

way before
I started copying you.

Whee...

[ birds chirping]

Ahh!

[ thud]

[ groaning]

My turn!

[ thud]

[ panting]

I wish I had
the old Patrick back

but he wants to be like me.

[ chime rings]

Hi, I'm Patrick Star.

I'm the laziest, pinkest
starfish in Bikini Bottom

and I wish I were me
and not SpongeBob.

What's so great
about being
a big pink loser?

Exactly.

I was never
closer to an award

than the minute
I started copying you.

But Patrick...

Patrick's not here!

DRIVER:
Trophy delivery!

Another trophy?

Oh, great!

What's it for
this time?

"For doing
absolutely nothing

longer than anyone else."

Patrick!

This trophy's
for you!

Yay!

Oh!

Eeee...

So, what are you
going to do now?

I'm going to go
protect my title!

[ snoring]

So, you thought 
I was kidding, huh?

No, in Bikini Bottom

excellence can be found 
even under a rock.

Every day is a holiday 
for SpongeBob

even if he has to make one up.

Hey, everybody!
It's Leif Eriksson Day!

Hingagingadurgin!

Ahoy, Patrick!
It's Leif Eriksson Day!

There's a note.

PATRICK: 
"SpongeBob, went to get 
more giant paper...

"Uhhhh, Patrick.

P.S.
Happy Leif Eriksson Day!"

PATRICK: 
Yagahingadinga!

Oh, so much for that.

Maybe Sandy will play with me.

Another note!

SANDY: 
"SpongeBob, went south 
for the winterLove, Sandy."

I don't get it
the water's fine.

Hey, Squidward, want to play?

SQUIDWARD: 
"No."

Are you sure?

"Yes."

Darn, I wish I had a buddy
to play with.

I knowI'll make one!

Stick Buddy!

Nah...

Rock Buddy!

Nope.

Sink Buddy!

[ drips]

Almost.

I've got it...

Bubble Buddy!

This... is... great!

I can't wait for you to meet
Squidward and Mr. Krabs.

Don't be shy... come on!

Please,
come again...

when I'm not working.

Next!

Hi, Squidward.

How am I supposed to
enjoy yourday off

if you come
to work anyway?

I want you to meet
my new friend, Bubble Buddy.

This bubble
is your friend?

Ahhaha...

Well, he's handsome
I'll give him that.

Hahaha.

What will it be?

Oh, I'm not hungry.

Well, thanks
for stopping by.

Wait! You haven't taken
Bubble Buddy's order yet.

Why would I do that?

He's hungry.

He's an inanimate object.

His money's no good here.

What are you saying,
Mr. Squidward?

Everyone's money
is good here.

At the Krusty Krab,
we serves all kinds.

I'm not taking an order
for a bubble.

Sure you are
or I'll fill your life
with misery and woe...

Even if you quit.

Make I take
your order?

Wait, Bubble Buddy.

Let me decide for you.

Hmm...

"Krabby Patty, Double Patty
Patty, Krabby Junior Junior

"Jumbo Small Patty,
Junior Senior Sophomore Patty

Quarter Ouncer
Double Pounder..."

Oh, it's all so good.

He'll just have
one of everything.

One of everything?! Whoopee!

[ electric buzzing]

I love Bubble Buddy!

Squidward, show
our best customer
to his table.

Bubble Buddy's
thirsty.

How about a glass
of our finest shampoo?

[ laughing]

Sounds great.

Oh.

Here's your haircare product,
sir.

Uh, Bubble Buddy
likes bendy straws.

Huh, what's that?

Bubble Buddy says
it tastes funny.

What do you think?

Mr. Krabs...

Think of the customer.

Oh, silly me
I got the
diet shampoo.

Here we goone of everything
for Bubble Buddy.

[ gasps]

Oh, no, Squidward, wait!

There's cheese on these patties.

And?

Bubble Buddy's
lactose intolerant

he can't eat cheese.

What should we do?

We?

How about youtake
these patties and sho...

KRABS:
Mr. Squidward...

Don't worry,
Bubble Buddy

Squidward will make
a fresh batch.

What, is he allergic
to bread, too?

Actually,
he doesn't like the crust.

And the ketchup should be
under the patty

and the pickles should be
on the left side

and you...

and Squidward...
and Squidward...

and Squidward...
and Squidward...

Here!
One of everything!

No cheese, no crust

pickles on left,
four squirts of ketchup

wheat buns,
nondairy lettuce

and farmraised tomatoes
carnivalstyle!

And if there's
anything else
I can do

please hesitate
to ask.

That was delicious.

Money's on the table,
Mr. Krabs!

So long, boys.

You see, Squidward,
the restaurant game
is all about service.

The customer
is always right.

Remember that, lad, and
you'll be as successful
as me one day.

Oh, you're right,
Mr. Krabs.

I learned my lesson.

And by the way,
Bubble Buddy
picked up the tab.

What's this?

Bubble money.

At least they
left a tip.

[ popping]

[ both growling]

SPONGEBOB:
Here we are, Bubble Buddy
Goo Lagoon.

There are lots of ways
to have fun here.

Dudes, bury me!

See what I mean?

All done.

All right!

Bubble Buddy,
you dig him out

while I get
some cotton candy.

Don't just stand there, dude
the tide's coming in.

Dude?

My friend's in there.

Congratulations.

Whoo... shake it!

Whoohoo!
Shake it, yeah!

Shake that bubble butt, yeah!

[ record scratches]

[ silence]

[ dancers grumbling 
selfconsciously]

DANCER:
Is my butt big?

[ watch ticking]

Oh... it's the worldfamous
surfer, Grubby Grouper!

Later, groupies!

Grubby's got
to go catch some
gnarly pounders.

[ howling]

Oh, I'll never wash
this flipper again.

SPONGEBOB:
Hey, Pearl

shake hands
with Bubble Buddy.

[ sobbing loudly]

[ crowd grumbling impatiently]

It's his first time
on his own.

Once again,
congratulations.

Popcorn, peanuts!

Icecold drinks!

[ SpongeBob whistling casually]

Two hours
is long enough!

That's it!

Hey, Bubble Buddy,
you're finished.

He kept us waiting for a bubble?

LOBSTER:
That's nothing

He called us fat!

He washed my flipper.

He owes me money!

He made me provide
excellent service!

Dudes, he made me
experience high tide.

Ohhh...

He poisoned our water supply,
burned our crops

and delivered a plague
unto our houses.

ALL:
He did?!

No, but are we just going
to wait around until he does?

I say we tip
something over!

ALL:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[ group grumbling]

Hey!

Now what?

ALL:
Get the lifeguard!

[ group grumbling]

Wait! Don't waste this
senseless violence on him.

It's that stupid bubble
of SpongeBob's

that's causing
all the problems.

Who's with me?

ALL:
Pop the bubble!

[ group cheering]

Hey, everyone!

Have you met my friend,
Bubble Buddy?

ALL:
Yes...

SPONGEBOB:
Hey, is this one of
those sewing circles?

GROUP:
No...

Would you stay back
with those pins?

Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy
uncomfortable.

SpongeBob,
that bubble's got to go.

Oh, no, he already
took care of that.

No"go" as in...

[ blowing]

[ popping]

Ah! Why?!

You and that bubble
have been nothing but trouble!

It's time
to end it.

No, I won't let you!

[ blowing]

Here we go!

SpongeBob:
You'll never catch us now!

Never... Aha!

Never!

Never.

Enough seahorsing around,
SpongeBob.

Give us that bubble!

GROUP:
Pop the bubble!
Pop the bubble!

Pop the bubble!

No, you can't!

He's not just
a bubble...

he's a Bubble Buddy.

He's my friend
and I love him.

Haven't you ever had
a very special friend?

[ crying and sniffling]

Nickel Buddy,
I'll never spend you.

Funny Muffler...

and Jerky Pal...

Booboo Keys...

Snake Eyes...

Both:
We love you!

So, what do you say?

GROUP:
Pop the bubble!
Pop the bubble!

Pop the bubble!
Pop the bubble!

Pop the bubble!

Pop the bubble!

Let's get this over with
so I can go home

and play my clarinet.

Nooo...

[ voice distorting, 
getting lower and lower]

[ moaning]

Whoa!

[ gasping]

Hey, don't I get
a say in this?

I'll see you later,
SpongeBob.

Things are getting
weird around here.

So long.

BUBBLE BUDDY:
Happy Leif Eriksson Day!

He's alive.

Of course.

Otherwise he couldn't tell
such funny jokes.

[ laughing]

[ group mumbling]

Okay by me... I'm gone.

Seems like
only this morning

I held his bottle.

[ sniffles]

They blow up so fast.

[ crying and snuffling]

Ah... hi.

Order up, Squidward!

[ note coming from bell]

[ alarm ringing]

Hey, hey, Squidward,
did you see me?

Okay, see you later,
Squidinater.

Good morning,
Mr. Squidward.

So, are you ready?

To go home?

No, to exchange
gifts

for Employee
Brotherhood Day.

Mr. Krabs, you pay me

to stand behind
this register

and take orders
and give change

but you could never
pay me enough

to act brotherly toward...

that guy!

Hmm.

[ laughs]

That attitude of yours

is precisely why
we're having this
little shenanigan.

Now, pay attention!

The lad's got
a surprise for you.

Squidward, in honor
of employee brotherhood

I present to you a gift...

Tadah!

SQUIDWARD:
"I heart you."

Try it on,
Mr. Squidward!

It's got you
written all over it.

I wasn't sure how big

to make the hole
for the head

so I used a watermelon
for size.

[ straining]

Do you love it?

It's a little itchy.

What's this thing made of?

Eyelashes!

[ whimpers]

Now, may I resume
my minimumwage duties?

After you present 
yourbrotherhood gift.

I'll buy the little twerp
a gumball.

Oh, no, no, no, lad;
you know the rules

you have to make
the gift.

The only thing I'm making
is for the exit.

Is this any better,
Squidward?

I made this one with my tears.

[ groans]

I knew you'd come around, boy.

Make something nice.

Why can't I just buy something
for the little weirdo?

MAN:
Heave ho!

If you drop one single
slice of me booty

I'll have... your booty!

[ straining]

Hi, there.

Those homemade pies
sure look good.

Oh, these aren't homemade.

They were made in a factory...

a bomb factory.

They're bombs.

Oh, well, that's too bad.

I thought they were pies
and I wanted to buy one.

Wait!

We were just kidding

about all that
bomb stuff.

That'll be
25 bucks, please.

So, what flavor is it?

Cherry.
Apple.
Raspberry.

Well, if it gets
old man Krabs
off my back.

Okay, here it is,
Mr. Krabs

fresh from the oven.

I'll be returning
to my life now.

Not yet!

I got to make sure
you did it right.

Wait a second...

this would got great
with some milk.

Oop.

[ tremendous explosion]

So, you tried to kill me

over a little newage
management, eh?

But Mr. Krabs,
I had no idea.

I can explain.

Mr. Krabs, are you okay?

I heard a... wow!

A pie!

It's from Squidward.

"To SpongeBob...

Well, here you go."

And that's what happened.

25 dollars?

A bomb?

BOTH:
In the Krusty Krab?!

That's where
you left it.

It's not there.

SPONGEBOB:
Hey, guys.

Mmmmmmmmmm.

Thanks for the pie, Squidward.

[ singing]

You had to kill him.

The boy cries you
a sweater of tears

and you kill him.

How are you going
to live with yourself?

Kill him?

Here's your order, sir.

Thanks.

[ explosion]

No, no, what we got...

we got to call the hospital.

Won't do any good
I've seen this before.

When that pie
goes up to bat

I mean, hits his
lower intestine

boom!

You've seen this before?!

11 times, as
a matter of fact.

[ dialing]

Yes, hello,
doctor? Hospital?

It won't do any good?

Eleven times?!

Oh!

Oh, he's a goner.

How do we tell him?

Don't tell him

that'll only make him
feel worse.

The way I see it,
he's only got till sunset.

Why ruin his
last day on Earth?

The lad deserves
to enjoy his final hours.

[ SpongeBob singing]

You're right, Mr. Krabs!

[ sobbing]

I'm going to make
SpongeBob's final hours

the best he's ever had.

And this time,
there's going to be love

so much he's going
to drown in it!

Drown in it!

"Note to self:
Watch out for Squidward."

[ singing]

Uh, SpongeBob?

Yes?

I forgot to tell you

there's a part two
to your gift.

"Part two"?

Part two, part two,
part two...

Uh, please
don't do that.

What's for part two?

Well, what's the most fun thing
you can think of?

Actually,
I keep a list

of the most fun things
I like to do.

I call it my
"friendship list."

Great...

Uh, let me see it.

The things
that are extra fun

I've written in red.

Everything's in red.

Yeah, I know.

We'd better start now

if want to get
through this list

before you die...
of anticipation.

Then let's roll!

Bye, Mr. Krabs.

[ crying]

Heads up, Squidward

looks like they're
going to replace you.

Yeah.

Uh, now let's have
a look at that list.

Well, the first thing
I want to do

is show my best friend,
Squidward

to everybody in town.

Hi there, this is
my best friend, Squidward.

Hey, kids, check it out:

This is my best friend,
Squidward.

Hi, I want to show you
my best friend, Squidward.

Hey, Frank.

Glad that's over.

Good, 'cause we're on
to our next activity.

Which is...?

I'm going to show

my best friend,
Squidward

to everyone in town
wearing a salmon suit.

You're going to be
wearing a salmon suit?

[ laughs]

That's a good one,
Squidward!

Next!

Knockknock jokes.

Hey, Squid, knockknock.

Who's there?

I am!

[ laughing]

[ pretends to laugh]

Oh, yeah...

[ beeping]

Look out, everyone,
friends in reverse!

[ beeping]

BOTH:
Oo...

Turn left, and... stop.

See, that's what
it would be like

if you had me
for a face.

I can't breathe.

Are you sure
you should be

poking it like that?

Who's the doctor here?

[ SpongeBob exclaiming]

The last thing
on the list is...

Does it involve
more dismemberment?

"Watch the sunset
with Squidward"

"Sunset"?

The way I see it, 
the lad's got 
until sunset

before that bomb hits 
his lower intestine.

Hey, it's Mr. Krabs.

Hi, Mr. Krabs.

[ weeping]

Okay, see you later.

Come on, buddy

You want a sunset,
you'll get a sunset.

SPONGEBOB:
Ah... underwater sunsets

sure are beautiful
eh, Squidward?

Yeah.

Yeah, this is great

just the three of us
you, me

and this brick wall
you built between us.

Yeah...

Sunsets remind me
of bowls of fruit.

What do they make you think of,
Squidward?

[ laughing]

[ exploding]

Explosions.

I mean, erosion.

You know, if I
were to die right now

in some sort of fiery explosion

due to the carelessness
of a friend

well, that would just be okay.

[ whimpering]

[ SpongeBob belches]

Wow, if feels like something

just dropped
into my lower intestine.

[ sniffs]

Hey, smells like cherry.

Or maybe grape.

Blueberry?

Here it is, the sunset!

I always love
to count it down.

Five!

You do the rest, buddy!

Uh, four...

three...

ttwo...

One!

I guess we started too early.

Let's start again.

Five, four, three...

[ explosion]

Two...

[ sobbing]:
One...

Well, at least I was able

to make his last few hours
meaningful.

I am such a good person.

[ explosion]

Hey, Squidward,
check this out.

[ blathering]

Squidward, we already played
"babble like an idiot."

Why are you still here?!

Since we finished everything on
the list, I made a new one.

I already filled up
this book with ideas.

We should be able
to finish by January.

Forget the book!

I spent the whole day with you

doing all kinds
of ridiculous things

because you
were supposed to explode!

You want me to explode?

Yes! that's what
I've been waiting for!

Um... okay, I'll try.

[ straining]

Gary! You are going
to finish your dessert

and you are going to like it!

[ laughs]

Now, it's your turn.

That's not what I meant,
you barnacle head!

Oo, good one.

No, you're supposed
to explode

into a million pieces.

Why would I do that?

Because the pie you ate
was a bomb!

What pie?

The one I left

on the counter today

that I bought
from pirates

for 25 bucks, and I
didn't know was a bomb

and you ate it, 
that pie!

Pie?

Oh, you mean this pie.

I was saving it
in my pocket

for us to share.

Let's eat.

Oops.

[ tremendous explosion]

SQUIDWARD:
Ouch...

NARRATOR [ in French accent]: 
Ah, the Krusty Krab

home of the Krabby Patty, 
with its top secret formula

known only to those brave 
enough and intelligent enough

to comprehend 
its culinary complexity.

Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm doing it,
I'm doing it!

KRABS:
Quit fooling around, SpongeBob,
we've got customers.

But wherever there is 
a secret recipe

there is someone 
who wants to steal it.

[ laughing evilly]

[ thud]

Ouch!

[ in electronic voice]:
And now for the final touch.

Perfect!

With this disguise

that formula is as good as mine.

[ laughing]

[ clears throat]

Are you SpongeBob
SquarePants?

Why, yes

yes, I am.

Then you've just won $1 million.

[ gasps]

You just have to answer
one question.

What is the Krabby Patty
secret formula?

[ inhales]

Yes.

[ inhales]

Yes!

[ inhales]

Yes!

The formula is
the sole property

of the Krusty Krab

and is only
to be discussed
with its creator.

Duplication
is punishable
by law.

Restrictions apply,
results may vary.

[ railroad alarm bells ringing]

[ screams]

That's it!

You better cough up
that secret formula or else!

Plankton!

Krabs!

Plankton!

Krabs!

SpongeBob.

You can't do this to me, Krabs.

[ inhales]

I went to college!

Ouch!

That Plankton is
a clever beast.

You've got to keep
a sharp eye out for
him, SpongeBob.

The Krabby Patty law
must be enforced.

The future of the Krusty Krab
depends on it.

Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.

As long as these pants
are square

and this sponge is Bob...

I will not let you down!

Uh, SpongeBob...

could you let me down?

MAN:
Man, these patties
sure are delicious.

I wonder what's in
that secret formula?

[ siren buzzes]

Code 12, code 12.

Your disguises can't fool me
this time, Plankton.

[ pop]

[ patrons gasp]

Everyone at the Head
Enhancement Clinic

said nobody would notice.

[ sobs]

KRABS:
SpongeBob!

You're scaring away me money.

Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I'm just trying

to protect
the secret formula.

That's no reason
to rip people's
heads off, boy.

Just remember the most
important rule.

No free napkins.

No! The other
most important rule

regarding the secret formula.

Only discuss the secret recipe
with Mr. Krabs.

As long as you do that,
the secret is safe.

I always thought
the most important rule was

"Why do today what you
can put off till tomorrow?"

[ laughs]

What is today but
yesterday's tomorrow?

Huh?

Today, I want you
to take inventory

on everything in here;

every last pickle
and patty must be
accounted for.

Aye, aye, captain.

[ electronic whirring]

Two boxes of buns.

Three pounds of patties.

[ in mechanical voice]:
Mr. Squidward.

What now, Mr. Krabs?

That's right, I am Krabs...

your boss, your ruler

your master.

[ laughs evilly]

Ha, ha, ha.

[ exhaust coughs]

You're not
Mr. Krabs.

Hey, why don't
you take the rest
of the day off?

[ chuckling]:
Well...

whatever you say,
"Mr. Krabs."

[ laughing]

Whoopee!

Hi, Mr. Krabs.

Oh, sweet domination.

This is it!

No sign of Plankton yet.

Gosh, Mr. Krabs, you
don't look so good.

Ooh, you're so cold.

[ hollow, metallic thumping]

That's just
my metal suit.

I made it to protect
the formula.

KRABS:
SpongeBob.

[ echoing]: 
SpongeBob!

It's that thickheaded Krabs.

He'll ruin everything.

Look, a jellyfish.

I got it, I got it.

[ buzzes]

I got it, I got it.

SpongeBob!

Hey, Mr. Krabs,
what happened

to your
metal pants?

Don't go all loopy
on me, boy.

I need your help.

And where in the high seas
is Squidward?

You gave him
the day off.

Day...

[ bellows]

I don't know the meaning
of them horrible words!

Now quit your laying
around, SpongeBob

and take out
that garbage.

It's starting
to give me a rash.

Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir.

Hey, Mr. Krabs, just
taking out that garbage.

Never mind thatI
need to talk to you.

[ beams zinging]

Whoaho, Mr. Krabs.

I didn't know
you had heat vision.

Never mind, I need
you to tell me...

KRABS:
SpongeBob!

Yike!

SpongeBob! I'm
not paying you

to stand around.

Get back to the kitchen.

But you wanted
to ask a question.

Yes... why aren't
you working harder?

[ hesitantly]:
I don't know, Mr. Krabs...

I don't know.

I'll never get that formula

with that pest, Krabs,
popping in and out like that.

I've got it!

I been saving this
for a rainy day.

It looks like
an ordinary penny...

because it isan ordinary penny.

That fool Krabs is too greedy
to ignore you, my little pretty.

[ laughing]

That sound, it sounds like...

the pitterpatter of...

money!

[ squeals]

Hey, where you going, beautiful?

Mr. Krabs.

Wha...

[ crash]

Stop!

KRABS:
Please!

Wait!

Nothing stands between me
and that secret formula now.

[ mechanical laughter]

[ thud]

Ouch!

Scrubbadubdub,
I love to rub.

Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing
a little scrubbing.

Hello, SpongeBob,
it is me, Mr. Krabs...

[ exhaust coughs]

in the flesh

standing right
in front of you

with no one else around.

I can see that, Mr. Krabs.

I thought we might
discuss the Krabby Patty
secret formula.

Isn't that
a microphone?

What?

Why, yes, it is.

I must get this
shirt cleaned.

All right, now tell me
the secret formula.

But, sir, we haven't done
the secret handshake yet.

Oh, yes, here,
let's shake.

[ giggles]

We don't shake
with our hands,
remember?

Uh, right, why don't you start.

We stand on one foot...

balance a glass
of chocolate milk
on our heads

and sing the Bikini Bottom
national anthem.

BOTH:
Oh, Bikini Bottom

We pledge our hearts to you

As faithful, as deep,
as true, as blue

Bikini Bottom, we love you.

Formula time?

Almost.

[ grunting frantically]

[ explosion]

Yum, yum, this spaghetti
sure is good.

Belch.

Both:
Meatball, meatball,
spaghetti underneath

ravioli, ravioli,
Great Barrier Reef.

[ clap]

Okay, now let's hear
that formula.

Sorry, no can do,
Mr. Krabs.

Whaaaat?

But we did everything you said.

I followed all the rules.

I even ate 105 black licorice
jelly beans through a straw.

Now, why can't you tell me
the formula?

It's your rule

never speak the formula.

You told me to keep it in...

this bottle.

[ bell dings]

This is it, Plankton.

Gently, now.

[ laughing maniacally]

[ gasps]

[ gasps]

[ gasps]

Gasp!

How could you, SpongeBob?

Giving me secret formula
to this... impostor?

Don't listen
to him, SpongeBob.

Rememberravioli,
ravioli, give me
the formuoli.

SpongeBob, no,
don't listen to him.

I'm the realMr. Krabs.

Don't listen
to him, he's
obviously a robot.

[ exhaust coughs]

Well, if I was a robot,
which I'm not

at least, I'm
well put together

not some rustedout,
steamdriven
pile of junk.

Who you calling
"steamdriven?"

SPONGEBOB [ screaming]:
QUIET!

Until I know who the real
Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves

nobody gets hurt.

BOTH:
Tartar sauce?!

Take it easy
with that thing.

[ screams]

I'll do the talking
around here.

I think I'll just ask you two
a couple of questions;

questions only the real
Mr. Krabs could answer.

Okay, then.

First question:
what time does
the Krusty Krab open?

9:30 AM.

Right.

That's one strike,
"Mr. Fake."

But...

Uh, uh, I'm running
this quiz show

I'll ask
the questions.

If there's going
to be any "buts"

there going
to be from me.

Okay, question number two:

How much does
a Krabby Patty cost?

$2.99.

On Wednesday.

99 cents.

Right again.

You're starting
to look pretty phony

right about now.

I'd be nervous
if I were you.

Now, only the really real
Mr. Krabs could answer this

if we're discussing
the secret formula

on the third Wednesday
in January

and it's not
raining outside

after we gargle
with pudding,
what do we do?

That's an easy one.

You just... just...
let's see, if it's a...

if it's January with...

with vanilla pudding,
you... uh...

pass.

[ grunts]

Wait!

SpongeBob!

Give me another chance.

So long,
imitation Krabs.

Byebye.

I knew it was you
all along, Mr. Krabs.

Here you go.

Thank you,
SpongeDupe.

[ mechanical laughter]

Whoop.

Don't forget
your lucky penny.

[ laughter continues]

Yoicks.

This must be
your lucky day.

[ laughs]

COMPUTER VOICE:
The selfdestruct coin slot
has been activated.

Ten seconds till detonation.

"Coinoperated selfdestruct?"

Not one of my better ideas.

[ screaming]:
Help!

[ massive explosion]

[ thud]

PLANKTON:
Ouch.

If that was
Plankton...

uhoh.

KRABS:
Help...

Yah, Mr. Krabs!

Ooh, yum, yum.

Back, you hungry
hand, back.

Help!

Gee, Mr. Krabs,
I'm sorry.

I thought you
were a phony.

Hoo, that's okay,
me lad.

Long as the secret
formula's safe again.

However, that penny's
coming out of
your paycheck.

[ both laughing]

SPONGEBOB:

NARRATOR: 
Ah... Sandy Cheeks 
is going out of town

and has asked 
SpongeBob and Patrick

to do a little petsitting 
for her.

Petsitting?

Won't that hurt them?

Perhaps she should have 
asked someone else.

[ whistling]

[ whistling]

Gee, Patrick, I didn't
know you spoke bird.

No, that's Italian,
SpongeBob.

[ grunting]

Okay, boys, this
here's Birdy's food.

Feed him twice a day.

This whole sack?!

Naw, just a cup's worth.

This here's
my cricket.

[ chirping]

[ laughs]
He's saying
hello to you.

Ain't he cute?

Uh, sorry,
I don't speak Italian.

Okay, and this
here's Snakey.

What's that lump
in his belly?

Well, that's
his dinner.

[ chuckling]

Well, I guess
that's it.

I got to go.

I'll see you fellers
in a couple of days.

BOTH:
Bye, Sandy!

[ gasps]

Wait! You forgot about this pet!

Oh, that's only Wormy.

He don't eat much.

Look at him, Patrick.

Isn't he great?

Hey, little fella.

Kitchykitchy
kookoo.

Aw, look, isn't he
just precious?

Let's take him out to play.

998... 999... 1,000.

Ready or not, here I come!

You found me!

BOTH:
There you are!

[ both giggling]

BOTH:
He found us!

A friend is a friend

That's what friends do♪

'Cause that's

Gee, SpongeBob, I don't
want today to end, ever.

I know, Patrick.

Days like today come

once, maybe twice,
in a lifetime.

Savor every moment.

And it's all
thanks to Wormy.

I made this for Wormy
our new best friend.

Until tomorrow,
new best friend.

Don't be sad,
little buddy.

We'll be back first
thing in the morning

for frolic and fun.

Why must the sun set
on this perfect day?

Sleep well, Wormy.

[ Patrick crying]

Aw, don't be sad, Patrick...

It's only until tomorrow.

[ crickets chirping]

[ ominous music playing...]

[ rooster crows]

Here I come, Wormy!

Me, too!

And, and then we're
going to play tag

and then we're
going to color

and then we're build
a house of cards!

BOTH:
We're back, Wormy!

Wormy! Wormy!

Wormy...?

Where's Wormy?

What's that thing?

He's got to be
in here.

I think something bad
happened to Wormy.

He left his Best Friend
ribbon behind.

[ loud buzzing]

[ both screaming]

What is that thing?!

I don't know,
Patrick.

But whatever
it is...

it must have eaten Wormy!

Why does this keep
happening to me?!

Quick, Patrick, we got to
make a run for the door!

[ panting and grunting...]

No! Patrick,
he's blocking our only exit!

[ panting and grunting...]

Now what?

We're trapped in here
with that...

that...
best friend eater!

Let's not panic.

We just have to stick together.

Remember, it's two against one.

Right, Patrick? Patrick?

Aah! He's eaten Patrick!

[ grunting and panting]

Patrick, you're alive!

I am?

Patrick, we can't just

leave this horrible monster
in Sandy's house!

It might eat
Sandy's other pets.

Or worse, it might
eat Sandy's pets.

No, it might eat Sandy.

We got to get it
out of here.

[ phone ringing]

It's for you.

It's working...

He's going to
answer it...

Tartar sauce!

You look pretty
appetizing, Patrick.

Now, just stay here
and wait for the monster.

I'll go get the net.

Oh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

SpongeBob, hurry up
with that net!

Hold on, Patrick!

I really don't taste
that good, Mr. Monster.

[ whimpering]

[ loud buzzing]

Oh...!

I'm coming, Patrick!

Oh, ooh...

[ crack, grunts]

No, Mr. Monster,
please don't eat me, no!

Spare me, I don't taste good.

No, please...

Wait a second.

Yeah!

We did it, Patrick!

Sandy's going to be
so proud of us.

We got that horrible monster
out of her house.

And best of all,
her pets are safe

'cause that horrible
creature is now...

headed straight
for the Krusty Krab!

It's going in the front!

Let's use the secret entrance.

[ both gasp]

Okay, hold still.

It's going to eat
Squidward and Mr. Krabs!

Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!

Say "money."

Money...! [ gasps]

[ grunting and yelling]

What's the meaning
of this, SpongeBob?!

We're in serious danger.

There's a, a, a...

a monster out there.

Is he a paying customer?

Oh, no, Mr. Krabs.

It doesn't want to
eat Krabby Patties.

It wants to eat you!

Just like it ate Wormy!

Uh, Wormy?

[ crying]

Oh, why, why?

He was so young...

We'll never
forget you, Wormy!

Well, if Moron
Theater's over

I think I'll
just take a look
at this monster.

That's the monster?

Pretty scary, huh?

A living nightmare!

I should have known.

Well, that's it.

I'm getting off
the Loonie Express.

Now, just because
you swabs

never seen a creature
like this

doesn't mean
it's dangerous.

We tried to warn them.

I can't watch!

Get a load of the scary monster.

[ laughs]

Monster...

[ laughs]

Aw, it looks harmless.

It's kind of cute.

It reminds me of money.

Monster...

[ laughs]

[ laughs]

[ loud buzzing]

[ both screaming]

Squidward?

Mr. Krabs?

Aah! It ate them!

And there it goes!

First Wormy,
then Squidward, Mr. Krabs...

That flying monster has eaten
three friends too many!

We must inform the citizens.

Evil has surfaced.

The fate of Bikini Bottom
is in our hands, Patrick.

Now, let's roll.

Ayeaye, captain.

[ engine whirring]

Okay, Patrick,
this is a very
delicate situation

and must be treated with
great care and sensitivity.

Gotcha.

Run, everybody, run!

Monster on the loose!

Monster!

[ crowd screaming]

[ crowd screaming]

[ both scream]

Huh?

Attention, Bikini Bottom!

There's a flying monster
that's going to eat you!

[ gasping and screaming]

[ all gasp]

Attention, attention!

This just in.

A giant monster

is attacking
Bikini Bottom.

[ screaming]

[ screaming and yelling]

[ siren wailing]

We did it, Patrick.

We saved the city!

Just think what
might have happened

Oh, hi there, Wormy.

You weren't supposed to
change till I got back.

That ought to hold you.

[ crowd cheering]

Howdy, SpongeBob.

Sandy caught the monster!

[ crowd cheering]

I didn't know I'd been
missed so much. Golly.

Maybe I should go
out of town more often.

Ah... ah... ahchoo!

[ sighs]

36 days without a customer.

So... hungry...

Aah! Mr. Krabs!

A customer!

Oh!

No food... three days...

Hold on, me bucko!

Food's on the way!

Hey... you got
money, right?

Yeah...

SpongeBob, bring
this man some grub

before he keels over!

Here you
go, sir.

Oh... Krabby
Patties, huh?

Finest
under the sea!

Yeah, yeah, sure,
but where's the pizzazz?

Huh?

Look at this place.

I mean, what is
the theme here?

Underwater?

It's boring!

Food... water...
atmosphere...

Nobody goes to a restaurant
for atmosphere.

They go for food!

Hey, Tom!

Fred! Hey, you want to
eat at the Krusty Krab?

Nah, let's go
to the Shell Shack.

They've got
a talking dog.

Great!
Say, what's a dog?

Money walking!

I need to think up
a gimmick like that

to get people back in here!

I have an idea.

Wait, I've got an idea!

KRABS:
And so,
ladies and gentlemen

make sure you buy
lots of Krabby Patties

as I bury myself alive!

[ whistling and cheering]

[ band playing]

Go, go, go!

[ cheering continues]

No free refills.

Hey, everyone, listen!

The talking dog
at the Shell Shack is singing!

Come on!

[ crowd cheering]

Mr. Krabs, I have an idea.

What am I
going to do?

If I don't find an idea,
I'll go out of business.

Mr. Krabs, I have an idea.

Why can't someone
give me an idea?

Mr. Krabs, I have an idea.

Great Neptune in heaven,
I need an idea!

Mr. Krabs... I have an idea...!

What in the name of money
are you waiting for, boy?

Tell me!

Okay, Mr. Krabs,
prepare yourself.

Don't bother sitting down

because you'll just stand up
when you see this.

Tada!

Great Barrier Reef!

That patty's spoiled!

[ laughs]

Mr. Krabs, it's
not tainted meat

it's paintedmeat.

Pretty Patties, available
in six designer colors.

[ laughs]

Mr. Squidward!

Come look.

Don't that
look appetizing?

Mmmm good, sir.

[ both laughing]

Wait! Give me an orange patty
with extra purple!

[ laughs]

What's next,
sequined milkshakes?

Bowtie french fries?

No...

Pretty Patties,
Pretty Patties.

Stop it...

[ laughing]

I know this is a good idea.

I'll show you.

I'll, I'll...

I'll open my own restaurant!

You'll see!

[ both laughing]

Hey, Patrick,
are you angry, too?

Yeah!

What's the matter?

I can't see
my forehead.

What's your problem?

I have a good idea and
no one else thinks so.

Me, too!

Inflatable pants!

What's your idea?

I'm going to open up
a restaurant

and sell
Pretty Patties!

Forget my dumb idea!

That's great!

Are you ready
for the big rush, Patrick?

Pretty soon those hungry
customers will be lining up

because we are open...

I'm ready!

I'm ready.

I'm ready...

[ bell tolls]

[ snores, gasps]

Patrick, how long have
we been sitting here?

Aw... I got to draw
a new battery for this.

What if Mr. Krabs
was right?

Maybe my idea is dumb.

[ crying]

SpongeBob, sometimes
we have to go

deep inside ourselves
to solve our problems.

I'm scared.

Then I'm going in
for you!

Gah...

Sorry...
stupid inflatable pants!

[ grunting]

Did you find anything?

Huh?

Hey, do you sell
food here?

[ both giggling]

Yes, sir!

We sell Pretty Patties!

That thing's green!

[ laughs]

Green!

[ laughing...]

[ laughing]

Green...

Mr. Krabs was right!

What am I going to do
with all these?

Hey, is that one purple?

Purple is
my favorite color!

This isn't half bad.

Hey, world,
Pretty Patties

is the best
idea ever!

WOMAN [ on TV]:
Oh, Rick, how could you?

[ Krabs crying]

...together,
we were one.

RICK:
That was before.

But now...

I'm splitting us up.

ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this program for
an important news announcement!

This wild throng behind me

is screaming for Bikini Bottom's
newest culinary sensation.

Let's take a listen.

ALL:
Pretty Patties!

Pretty Patties!

Pretty Patties?

ANNOUNCER:
It's easy to see that
Pretty Patties are popular.

But just what is it
about them

that drives Bikini Bottom
feeders wild?

ALL:
They match our purses!

They remind me of home.

Pretty Patties rule!

ANNOUNCER:
Mr. SquarePants, how do you
explain all this success?

Uh... I don't know.

How can you make money
with such a stupid idea?

And how can you not make money
with such a brilliant idea?

[ laughs]
At first we didn't know
what to do with all the money.

We tried burying it...

shredding it...

and burning it.

Aah!

But in the end, we decided
to just give it all away.

Come again, sir!

I'm getting back in line!

I don't believe it!

[ panting]

I got to see this for meself!

Ooh!

Hey, watch it, buddy.

I don't care how much
you want your Pretty Patty.

You're going to have wait
in line like the rest of us.

I never had a line!

Who's number 46,853?

[ crowd roars]

I never had 46,853 customers.

Here you go, sir.

Stay pretty.

[ laughs]
All right.

Mr. Krabs,
is that you?

Isn't this great,
Mr. Krabs?

The pretty patties
are a big hit.

They sure are, boy.

You're doing pretty well
for yourself.

I guess you've completely
forgotten the Krusty Krab.

No, sir, I haven't.

In fact, sometimes I really miss
the old days at the Krusty Krab.

I bet you miss Squidward...

and the grill...

and the crow's nest.

Yeah, yeah!

And you know what I miss
the most, Mr. Krabs?

That tiny squeaky sound you get

when you rub
two pickles together.

You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?

Uh... uh, yeah...

uh, yes,
yes, I do, lad.

Well,
the Krusty Krab

is only
a short walk away.

Why don't you
head on down

for old times' sake?

Ooh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs.

What about the stand?

Oh, don't worry,
lad.

I'll watch the stand
for ye.

You will?

No... I've got
a better idea.

I'll take this old
roadside stand

off your hands...
for keeps.

And in exchange

I'll give you
the Krusty Krab

with Squidward,
the grill

and all those
squeaky pickles.

What did you say, Mr. Krabs...?

Here's the key
to the Krusty Krab.

She's yours now.

Thank... you.

What should I do now,
Mr. Krabs?

Run to her, boy.

She's waiting for ya.

I can't feel my legs,
Mr. Krabs.

Don't worry, lad,
I'll fix it!

Get this to the Krusty Krab,
on the double!

Good luck, lad!

Dreams do come true...

[ gasps]

[ yelling and laughing...]

Ladies and gentlemen

Pretty Patties is now
under new management!

Who's next?

CROWD [ yelling]:
I am... I am... Over here...

[ crickets chirping]

[ rooster crows]

I'm ready, I'm ready...

I'm ready... for me money.

Welcome to Pretty Patties.

May I take your money?

We want a refund, Krabs.

[ crowd yelling]

Who, how, what?

Your dumb Pretty Patties

turned my face purple!

Look what I got under my kilt!

ALL:
And look at our tongues!

What's wrong with you?

We want our money back.

All 46,853 of us.

Hey, where did he go?

[ screaming]

Get him!

[ crowd yelling]

[ panting...]

Oof!

My key! Where's my key?!

SpongeBob! SpongeBob, let me in!

Thanks, Grandma!

SpongeBob...
you forgot your kissykissy!

I sure did.

[ kisses]

Bye, Grandma!
Thanks for the ride!

Thank you, Squidward.

[ others chuckling]

Oh, brother...

[ whistling]

Isn't this great?

Everybody's
in a good mood today.

I love bursting
your bubble, SpongeBob.

They're laughing atyou,
not with you.

Did I do
something funny?

Your forehead.

My forehead is funny?

Hey, grandma's boy!

Kissykissykissy!

[ all laughing...]

No! You're wrong!

There...
there's nothing wrong

with getting kisses
from your grandma!

No... especially if you're
a big baby who wears diapers!

[ all laugh]

And, and sucks his thumb

and plays with dolls

and, um, wears pajamas
with feet in them

and carries his, um, uh,
binky around, and, uh...

OTHERS:
All right already!

Cheer up, SpongeBob.

I know someone
who still likes you.

Really?
You do, Squidward?

Yeah... your grandma!

[ all laughing...]

[ laughter continues...]

[ all laughing...]

[ grunting]

[ all laughing]

Stop it...!

I have been publicly humiliated
for the last time!

[ crying]

PATRICK:
I'm sorry that happened
to you, SpongeBob.

Me, too.

You're the most adult person
I know.

Thanks, Patrick.

You know how grandmas are.

They love babies.

You just can't act
like a baby around her.

You're right, Patrick.

Have I ever not been right?

[ sizzling]

[ honking]

[ wolfwhistle]

You're a man now,
SpongeBob

and it's time you
started acting like one.

Yeah!

Oh... but I'm not sure
I know how.

Allow me
to demonstrate.

First,
puff out your chest.

Now say "tax exemption."

Tax exemption!

Now you must acquire
a taste for freeform jazz.

[ trumpet plays fast jazz riff]

Okay, SpongeBob,
you're ready!

This is it.

What are you going
to tell Grandma?

I'm a grownup.

No ifs, ands or buts about it.

A man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

And then you get behind her
and I'll push.

Patrick, we didn't say that.

Oh, yeah, right.

All we need now

is the icing
on the maturity cake.

I've been growing
these babies for years.

BOTH:
Sideburns...

Oh, hello, SpongeBob.

What a nice surprise.

Come here, give your granny
her kissykissy.

Mmm...

[ kisses]

Sorry, Grandmother,
but the kissing has to stop.

Tell her like it is, SpongeBob.

No more baby stuff.

He is right, Grandmother.

Kisses are for babies,
which I am no longer.

I have grown up.

It is nature's way.

Oh... you are absolutely right.

I am?

I mean, of course I am.

You will definitely
not be treated like a baby

around here ever again.

I am glad you see it
my way, Grandmother.

GRANDMA:
Well, I'm glad
that's settled.

But what am I
going to do

with all these
freshbaked cookies?

[ chuckles]
Sorry, Grandmother.

We adults don't partake
in the consumption of sweets.

Right, Pat...

rick?

Keep 'em coming,
Granny!

[ slurping]

So much for no more baby stuff.

And don't forget the
cookieeating hat!

[ laughs]

[ both laughing]

Hey!

That's my cookieeating hat!

Uh... I mean, it was
when I was a baby!

Grr...

Well, look who's here.

It's my big old
adult grandson.

Grandmother, I need to have
a mature conversation

with Mr. Patrick.

Patrick!
What are you doing?!

Cookies! Warm milk!

A bib!

Is that a kissy mark
on your forehead?

We are supposed to be adults!

Uhuhuh.

No roughhousing
with a full tummy.

[ laughing]

Who's the baby?

I'm the baby, I'm the baby,
I'm the baby!

[ clears throat]

Being grownup is boring!

I love being a baby.

Besides, I don't get jazz.

Oh, poor Patrick.

I almost feel sorry for you.

Trapped in the awkward phase
of diaper days.

Never to know
the rich rewards
of being a grownup.

Here's a fresh batch of cookies.

All right!

[ munching]

Rewards, huh?

Well, yeah, there's...

[ munching]

Let's see, we, uh...

we went over the jazz.

[ munching]

Oh, Grandma,
I'm full.

More cookies.

[ vacuum cleaner running...]

[ whistling]

It appears to be my lunch hour.

Grownups have to eat, too.

I guess this will have to do.

GRANDMA:
Oh, you don't want
this baby food.

How about a big piece
of steamed coral?

Oh, yeah, uh... great.

[ crunching]

Nutritious!

GRANDMA:
Story time!

Oh, boy! Story time,
story time, story time!

Story time?

You'll enjoy this,
Patrick.

It's a wonderful story
about a magical sea leprechaun.

Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be
interested in this babybook.

Here's the technical manual
on Routine Active Maintenance.

Oh, uh, great.

Yeah... fascinating.

No pictures, just the way
I like it.

[ munching]

[ crunch]

Ohh! My wittle finger!

Hold still,
hold still.

[ kisses]

All better?

PATRICK:
Sorta...

This finger hurts
a little bit, too.

[ Grandma kisses]

How about I give you
a present?

Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!

All right!

Another hat!

No, Patrick, it's a sweater.

Huh?

With love in every stitch.

No...

Don't I get
a present,
Grandma?

Oh, I almost forgot.

Here's some
office supplies.

I didn't wrap them.

I knew
you wouldn't mind.

[ clock chimes 3:00]

Uhoh, 3:00.

Time for adults to go to work.

Byebye, SpongeBob.

I'll bet you would fancy
a nap, huh, Patrick?

[ Patrick yawns]

GRANDMA:
You're still here,
SpongeBob?

Uh... I don't have to leave yet.

I... can be late for work.

No, no, no. That wouldn't
be the adult thing to do.

All right, uh,
I guess I'll be going.

I've, uh, got a lot
of adulttype business

to take care of,
so, uh...

I'll see you later.

Okay. Thanks for
stopping by, SpongeBob.

Yup, that is it.

Here I go.

Come again if you
get the chance.

Out into the cold,
grownup world...

alone... without a sweater.

Toodleoo.

I don't know when I'll be back.

I know how busy you are.

So, uh... that's it.

Shh... he's asleep.

So... long...

I don't want to grow up!

I want cookies!

And milky!

I want a sweater
with love in the stitches!

I want to wear didies!

I want to ride in my wagon!

I want to cuddlewuddle
with Mr. Stuffykins!

I want to rockyrock
on my seahorsey!

And I want kissykissy
on my booboo!

[ crying]

[ crying...]

[ continues...]

[ wailing...]

[ continues...]

[ ratcheting 
like lawn sprinkler...]

Take it easy, SpongeBob!

SpongeBob...

SpongeBob!

[ crying and panting]

You don't have to
be a baby

to get
Old Grandma's love.

[ sniffles]

I don't?

Of course not.

No matter
how grownup you get

you will always be
my Little Baby Boo.

[ kisses]

And remember, you can
kiss your Grandma

and still be an adult.

Here you go.

Thanks, Grandma.

[ munching and sighing]

Uh, Grandma,
could you not mention this

to the guys
down at The Krusty Krab?

No problem.

[ squeak]

[ Squidward snickers]

[ all laughing...]

[ SpongeBob shrieks]

[ panting]

Patrick, look, I
got my... [ gasps]

[ laughs]

I'm sorry, Patrick.

It's just,
for a second I thought...

Hey, you got the same
reefblower as me!

[ whirs loudly]

Tag, you're it!

[ laughs]

[ loud whirring, both laughing]

[ laughs]

[ whirring]

[ laughs]

[ laughs]

[ whirring]

Patrick...

you made my house
sparkly clean!

Sure did!

We haven't improved
Squidward's day yet.

Let's do his house!

[ whirring]

[ creaking]

[ laughs]

My turn!

[ whirring]

What's going on out here?!

We're playing
with our new reefblowers.

Playing with a reefblower?

That is the most childish thing
I've ever heard of!

But it's fun!

Fun? How could playing

with one of those oversized
hair dryers possibly be fun?

PATRICK:
Like this.

[ whirring]

[ grunting]

Chafed!

All right, that's...

[ whirring]

Let's do your house,
Patrick.

Yeah!

Huh?

[ panting, sizzling]

SPONGEBOB:
Squidward,
you're steaming!

You're like a steamed
vegetable, only smarter.

Put my windows back!

No problem,
Squidward.

We're on
your side.

[ whirring]

Any second now...

SpongeBob...

this is
the final straw.

I am going to move
so far away

that I will be able
to brag about it.

I would...
[ clunk]

I would rather
tear out my brain stem

carry it
into the middle

of the nearest
fourway intersection

and skip rope with it

than go on living
where I do now.

Hi there.

Is this the final straw?

Do you want to move so far away
that you can brag about it?

Would you rather
tear out your brain stem

walk out into the middle
of the nearest threeway...

Fourway...

Fourwayintersection

and skip rope with it

than continue living
where you do now?

Then move to...
[ static]

I hate this channel.

No, no!

...Tentacle Acres.

Where happiness is
just a suction cup away.

[ pop]

Hello?

Yes, can I help you?

I'm here about the happiness.

I'll be moving in now.

Are you alone?

No... I mean, yes,
there's nobody with me, yes.

Peace and quiet.

Are you now or have you
ever been a sponge?

No.

What about a...

No, no starfish.

Just a regular, normal,
peaceloving...

[ loud rumbling]

[ doors creaking]

[ kids laughing]

Heaven at last...

BOTH:
Ohh!

I've seen
more alert people

in a retirement home!

Oh, which way to
the Living Without
a Brain seminar?

Don't be late!

I've heard
better comebacks

from a turkey
sandwich!

Get a life!

This place is better
than I expected!

302... 303... and 304.

Beautiful!

And not a pineapple in sight.

Good night, Clary.

Tomorrow we begin life anew.

[ phone ringing]

304 New Life Street,
Squidward speaking.

[ SpongeBob babbling]

There is no way I am moving
back there, SpongeBob!

I am finally among my own kind.

[ SpongeBob babbling]

Now goodbye!

[ babbling]

[ babbling]

[ rooster crows]

[ inhales deeply]

Ahh...

I think I'll take my bike today.

[ creaking...]

I'm my own man.

[ clunk]

Now, these neighbors
know how to live.

Intensive...!

Hmm... I bet they won't have...

[ gasps]
Wow! They have it!

Canned bread!

This town is great!

I would really be
impressed if it had...

an interpretive dance academy!

[ music playing...]

Yeah... it's even better
in a group!

This town is perfect!

[ clarinets playing...]

A clarinet trio?!

[ all playing...]

[ rooster crows]

[ inhales deeply]

Ahh... another great day!

Oh, look.

Everybody's on their bike today.

It just gets better and better.

All together.

[ all playing]

I sort of... don't feel
like playing my clarinet today.

Yup, this is great.

They might as well rename
this town Squidward's Paradise.

Or perhaps... Too Much Paradise.

[ whirring]

SpongeBob?

Feh...

[ whirring...]

[ laughs]

[ whistling]

Oops.

[ whirring]

Ohh!

[ grunting]

[ grunts]

[ chuckles]

[ clears throat]

Leaves.

Just getting the leaves.

[ whirring]

[ chuckles]

[ whirring]

[ laughing]

[ whirring]

[ laughs]

[ whirring]

Oof!

[ laughs]

Could you pipe down
over there, Iron Lung?

[ both laugh]

[ whirring]

[ laughs]

Looks like when it comes
to having fun

you don't have
a leg to stand on.

[ laughing]

Hey, that's not funny!

Yeah!

What's going on
over here?

It's that guy.

He's playing
with a reefblower.

Playing? With a reefblower?

That's the most childish thing
I've ever heard of.

But it's fun.

[ laughs]

How could you
possibly have fun

with one of those
oversized hair dryers?

Like this!

[ whirring]

[ clarinet tooting]

Ahh! Give it back! Please!

[ whirring]

[ laughing]

Tag, you're it!

[ whirring]

Whoa...!

[ laughing]

What can I get you boys?

[ whirring...]

[ laughing...]

What are you
looking at?

Those.

SPONGEBOB:
Here it is, Patrick.

Now we've just got to convince
Squidward to come back home.

You got our apology cake?

We're ready!

Yay!

Hello, can I help you?

Can I get
a large number
one, extra size?

But you just ate three orders
of fried oyster skins.

I love...
fried oyster skins.

We're sorry, but your kind
isn't allowed here.

He's not leaving,
Orville.

You got your
nightstick ready?

[ sniffs]

Fried oyster skins?!
Oh...

[ buzz]

[ doors creak]

I guess we got to
order inside.

[ yelling]

[ laughing]

[ whirring]

[ laughing]

[ crowd yelling]

[ laughing]

Hey! That looked
like Squidward!

[ yelling]

That looked
like Squidward also

in angry mob form.

Hold it right there,
Mr. Tentacles!

Stay back!
I got gardening tools!

Here,
just read this!

What is it?

A well thoughtout and
organized list of complaints.

[ crowd yelling]

Patrick, look,
it's Squidward!

Squidward!
We finally found you!

Get off me!

I'm not Squidward.

Are you
Squidward now?

Grievances?!

This town is a grievance!

There should be a law

against so many stuckup
tightwads living in one place!

This city needs
to be destroyed!

Or at least painted
a different color.

F.Y.I., you don't
have to live here,
you know.

Hey, you're right!

And I'm leaving A.S.A.P.

Are you Squidward?

No.

Are you Squidward?

No.

Are you Squidward?

That's okay,
take your time.

Any one
of these Squidwards

could be the real
Squidward, Patrick.

[ boom]

[ whooshing]

Whoaho, freedom!

Whoohoo!

[ Squidward laughing]

Well, we know one thing...

It sure isn't that guy.

Whoohooee!

Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

[ Sandy humming...]

There we go!

Hey SpongeBob, I got
all the leaves rake...

[ leaves crunching]

SpongeBob! What are
all these leaves doing here?!

You said you were
going to rake 'em!

I am raking leaves.

But they're still
all over the ground!

Sandy, I can't rake any faster!

These are big leaves!

[ grunting, snap]

And they keep breaking
into more leaves!

Then go scrape the salt lick
or somethin'!

We got to get this stuff done
before it's too late!

What's the big rush anyway,
Sandy?

I told ya, SpongeBob..

I'm hibernating next week!

Hibernating? What's that?

It's when I go to sleep
for the whole winter.

Can I do that?

[ giggles]
No, silly!

It's a mammalian
thing!

Sandy, you may not
have noticed...

but I is 100% mmale.

[ vacuum running]

Enough chitterchatter,
SpongeBob.

We don't have much time left!

Why Sandy? When does your...

carburationbegin?

In one week!

But Sandy..
that only gives us...

one... two... three...
[ gasps]

168 more hours
of playtime!

You're tellin' me!

And there's still
so much to do!

We got to climb
some things.

Climb!

We got to jump
off of stuff.

Jump!

We got to ride!

Ride.

I don't wanna
go to sleep yet!

I can't burn carbs
in my sleep!

Sandy?

What?!

Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice

any of my time that I haven't
already sold to Mr. Krabs
to you.

Well, I'm glad,
SpongeBob

'cause for the next
seven days

it's going to be you...
me...

and these sweatbands!

[ Pantera playing...]

Yeeha...!

Uh... I can explain.

I'm hotter than
a hickorysmoked sausage!

Whoohoo!

Oop! Bleh...

Maybe, if we
sing that song

he'll come to life!

Ready?

BOTH:
Oh, there once
was a sandman...

Life's as extreme

as you wanna make it!

Whoo!

Maybe we didn't
sing it right.

[ cracking]

Yeah...

Whew!

What a workout!

I'm going to be feeling
this tomorrow. Ow.

I got to say, I'm impressed
with you, SpongeBob!

You're makin' this the best
prehibernation week ever!

Well.. I'd better get home

before Gary chews up
the sofa again.

[ sighs]

[ cracking and groaning...]

[ cracking and groaning 
continue...]

[ groaning...]

[ sighs]

Goodnight, Gary!

[ snoring and mewing]

[ crickets chirping, beep]

[ Pantera playing...]

Aah...!

[ shuddering]

Whoohoo!

Nothin' like
a refreshing morning dip

huh, SpongeBob?

Wwwhat hhhappened
to sssleeping?

I'll be asleep
all winter!

We only got three days for fun!

Well, hurry now!

The giant clams like
to feed at this hour.

[ grunting]

[ blows whistle]

[ panting...]

Isn't this great?!

Yeah! I've never played
extreme jacks before!

Okay, SpongeBob,
this one's going to be fun!

We just whack each other
with these giant ear cleaners

till one of us falls off!

On your mark...
get set...

Sandy, are you sure

we're supposed to be
standing up here?

Go!

SPONGEBOB:
Aah...

Ooh!

Come on, SpongeBob!

We're goin' for a tandem ride
through the park.

Gee, that sounds safe.

I mean fun!

[ grunts]

Okay, I'm ready.

[ Pantera playing...]

[ panting]

I thought you said

we were riding
through the park, Sandy!

I did, SpongeBob...

the industrial park!

This is where
the real action is!

Come on, pedal!

This part gets pretty technical!
Yeehaw!

Now for
the speed course!

Hang on!

I hope we make it!

Aah... aah...!

I'm havin' fun, too!

Wake up, slowpoke!

We're goin' fly fishin'!

[ thinking]: 
This squirrel's 
trying to kill me!

Any more of these stunts and 
I'll be reduced to a puddle!

Wait a minute... I got to 
talk my way out of this!

Sandy, I need
to tell you something...

What is it?

Well, it's just

that I'm feeling sort of...

[ gurgling]

I just feel like maybe
I need to... [ gurgling]

Hold that thought,
SpongeBob

'cause it's time for
a downhome favorite!

Find the hay
in the needle stack!

[ Pantera playing...]

[ teeth chattering]

Ow, ow, owowow,
ooh, owowow...

Ouch.

Did ya find it?

Not yet!

Well, I'm going to look
over here!

You do that.

Found it, SpongeBob!

Come on!
Best two outta three!

[ panting]

Got to hide! Ggot to hide!

Home? No!
Gary can't keep a secret!

Under a rock?

It's so original!

[ grunts]

SpongeBob...?!

[ grunting]

SpongeBob...?

Where are you,
little square dude?
[ gasps]

SpongeBob's tie!

And all his other
little dressin's!

But... but...
he always folds his clothes

before running around
in the nude!

Something terrible
must have happened to him!

All right! Listen up, y'all!

I'm roundin' up a search party!

SpongeBob's gone missin'!

Man the lifeboats!

Alpha Team, you search uptown!

Gold Team searches downtown.

Any questions?

Gold Team rules!

SANDY:
Now get movin'!

[ crowd yelling...]

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob!

Someone look up there!

Here, boy!

Put your dorsal fins
into it!

SANDY:
Come on!

He could be anywhere
in these sulfur fields!

Hey, SpongeBob?

Well, at least I still
have my personality.

Check in this here
moist cave!

ALL:
SpongeBob?

Aah...!

Status report!

He's not in the poison
sea urchin cove.

Well, look again!

He's not
at the leech farm.

Well, look again!

He's not
in my thoughts.

Well, think again!

Attention, Bikini Bottom!

The time has come to double...
no, triple our efforts!

SQUIDWARD:
How about a break?!

We've been at it
for days!

Think about the children!

That's a good idea!

Use the children to crawl
into small places

you couldn't normally reach!

[ whispers]:
This is a load
of barnacles.

I heard that!

No one's going anywhere

till we find SpongeBob!

Uh... oh, wait...

Um, here he is!

That ain't SpongeBob!

SpongeBob is square!

[ grunting]

I'm ready! I'm ready!

No, you ain't!

I found SquareBob!

That's just a cereal box!

Besides, he's yellow!

Uh, here he is!

Hey, can I go home now?!

Oh, look!
He's up in the sky!

He's not... huh?!

They must've gone
to search some more!

[ someone coughs]

SpongeBob?!

Where are you?!

[ grunts]

You under there?!

[ grunts]

Nope!

[ grunts]

Uh, I can explain.

SpongeBob?! [ grunts]

Nope!

[ grunts]

Nope!

[ grunts]

Nope!

SpongeBob, where are you?!

[ crashing, grunting...]

SANDY:
Nope... nope... nope...

MAN:
That squirrel's
gone crazy!

WOMAN:
But she'll never look
under a rock!

SPONGEBOB:
[ laughs] You said it!

Sandy'll never find us!

[ laughs nervously]

Hey, wait!

You don't understand!

Oh, look, it is I,
SpongeBob

out here in the open.

SpongeBob?

Aah...!

Come on! Let me back in!

You don't understand!

[ cheering...]

Oh, SpongeBob!

I was so worried!

I thought somethin'
terrible happened!

Come on! There's just enough
time to go atomsmashing!

Sandy, wait!

There's no time to wait!

Hibernation!

Sandy, you got to make time!

This is important!

[ gulps]

I... am a man!

Okay Sandy, I... I... I... I...

I can't play with you anymore!

I just can't take the games!

They're... tearing me apart!!

[ crying]

There, I said it.
[ sniffles]

Now just promise we
can still be friends.

Please, Sandy?

This isn't easy.
I...

[ snoring...]

Sandy?

[ snoring...]

[ laughs]

I never though I'd say it

but thank Neptune
for hibernation!

[ laughing]

[ snoring]

[ both snoring...]

Who are you people?!

TV ANNOUNCER: 
And now back to
Crustacean Crime Theatre.

[ snoring]

[ laughing evilly]

[ gasps]

[ laughing]

Stop! Thief!

Which way
did he go?

He went that way!

Let's get 'em,
boys!

[ police yelling]

Curses! Foiled again!

What a nogood eel
in the kelp that guy was!

There ain't nothin' worse
than a thief!

Thieves need to be
locked up forever!

They should all be strung up
by their gills

and forced to breathe air!

But Mr. Krabs?

What about all the stuff
you stole?

What do you mean?

Like that barrel.

It says "Property
of Salty Sea Farms."

Oh! That's where I rent
me pickles from!

Are you renting
the barrel?

Well... no.

Then you bought it?No.

Then isn't that stealing?Well, I, uh...

What about this towel from
The Sizzling Spring Sauna?Um... well...

And this Bikini Bell phone?Well, uh, it's...

And Sandy's hedge clippers?Oh, they're...

And Plankton's lawn mower?Well, he...

Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers?

That one was a gift.
Listen...

All that stuff is, uh...
borrowed.

Borrowed?
Well, that's a relief.

I thought you took it
without permission.

Ah, permission shmermission!

You can borrow
anything you want, anytime

as long as you get it back
before it's missed!

Everyone knows that! Right?

BOTH:
Okay!

All right then! Hugs?

You put in a hard day's
work, boys!

PATRICK:
But I don't work here.

See ya later!

Oh, that was a close one.

SPONGEBOB:
What do you want to do today?

I don't know.

What do you want
to do today?

I don't know.

What do you want
to do today?

I don't know.

What do you want
to do today?

I don't know.

What do you want
to do today?

[ gasps]

I know what I want to do today!

I need some money.

Uh...

Uh...

Oh!

Oh...

I don't have
any money.

SpongeBob!

I want a balloon
really, really badly!

Really, really badly!

It's okay, Patrick.

There's lots of money

in the First National Bank
of SpongeBob!

Follow me...!

Uhoh. I'm broke, too.

Maybe we can borrow money
from Squidward.

Wait! Instead of
borrowing the money

why don't we just borrow
the balloon?!

Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!

It's just
borrowing,
right?

Yeah! And borrowing
is okay

as long as we bring it
back, right?

Right!

[ whistling]

[ both laughing]

This is so great!!

We're going to have
so much fun!

First we can run
with the balloon.

Yeah, then we can
go to the beach
with the balloon!

Then we can take a bike ride
with the balloon.

Then we can go to the movies
and the arcade and the ice rink
and the pizza shop!

And the moon and the sky
and under a car and
behind a dumpster

And the candy shop

and my backyard

and in a plane

and over a rock

and under a hill

and with a whale.

BOTH:
We love borrowing!

It popped.

BOTH:
Aah...!

How are we going to
return it now, SpongeBob?

I've got the pieces!

I found the air!

Hurry, put the pieces on!

We popped the balloon!

Gahee...!

We can't return it!!

Whaguh...!

We're thieves!

Hiyohoo...!

We have to confess!

Confess?!

Are you out of
your mind?

Do you have any idea

what they do
to people like us?

We're not
talking about

some dumb mail
fraud scheme

or hijacking here.

We stole a balloon!

They're going to
lock us up forever!

You're right!

We've just got to
keep our heads!

Act normal.

[ both gibbering wildly]

Wow! Street
performers!

[ crowd cheering]

BOTH:
It's not working!

BOTH:
Aah...!

[ both grunt]

Hi there!

BOTH:
Aah...

Hey! Don't you want
a free balloon?

It's National Free Balloon Day!

[ panting]
He's on to us!

[ panting]
It's not safe in
Bikini Bottom anymore!

We've got to move fast
and cover our tracks!

I'm on it, SpongeBob!

[ both panting]

Take a last look, Patrick.

We can never go back.

Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.

We've only got ourselves and
what we can carry on our backs.

Yup.

[ grunting]

We're going to have
to travel lighter.

[ crickets chirping]

I want to go home.

We can never
go home, Pat.

We're wanted men.

We'll spend the rest of our
lives running... running...

but at least it's warm
around the fire.

Hey, if we're underwater,
how can there be a...

I'm scared, SpongeBob!

No more nice warm beds.

Huh?

No more Krabby Patties.

Oh!

No more getting mail!

No more Gary!

No more movies!

No more Squidward!

No more Sandy or Pearl
or Mr. Krabs!

No more anything!

I want ice cream!

But it doesn't have to
be all bad, right?

I mean... at least
we have each other.

Yeah!

And all that running

is good for your buns
and thighs.

Ja!Buns and thighs.

And the bitter cold?

It's bracing, isn't it!

Yeah! Maybe being a felon
could be... fun!

We can loosen our ties.

Yeah!

And we can fly!

Yeah!

Aah...!

[ crash]

Okay... we still
can't do that!

But we don't
have to shave.

I'm way ahead of you, buddy!

And you get to talk tough!

[ gruff voice]:
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

Let me try!

Uh... hey punk... hehheh!

And the best part is...

now that we're felons

we don't have to return
anything we borrow!

BOTH:
Yeah!

And we owe it all to you!

What are you talking about?

Taking the balloon
was your evil plan.

Oh, I'm nothing
but a lot of talk!

You're the one
with the sticky fingers.

Aw, Patrick...

you're the best
bad influence ever!

You, too!

[ both sigh happily]

I wish we had something
to eat, though.

Look what I've got!

Rectangles!

Not just
any rectangles...

candy bars!

Oh...!

All we have to do is make them
last the rest of our lives!

Thanks, SpongeBob!

I think I'll eat it now!

Ah...

I think I'll eat it now.

[ crunch]

Ow! Who...?

Where did my candy bar go?

I must have dropped it!

You just ate it, Pat.

It's all over your face.

Where did it go?

I'm going to starve!

Where did it go?

[ grunting]

I can't find it!

Where could it possibly be?

Aha!

What?

You stole my candy bar!

No, I didn't.

Oh, so that's
how it is, huh?

Once a thief,
always a thief.

You ate yours.

This is mine!

You took my only food.

Now I'm going to starve.

Here, Patrick, just
take half of mine.

Yours? You mean mine!

Do you want it or what?

I don't want it unless
you admit you took it.

This is my candy bar!

Liar liar, plants for hire.

It's pants on fire, Patrick.

Well, you would know... liar.

Well, if you're going to be
that way... I'll eat it myself.

You'd better not.

I'm warning you!

Ah...

Don't!

Ah...

Stop it!

Don't!

Oh!

Mmm...

Argh...!

[ squeaking]

[ screaming]

Uhm... mmm... mmm...

Argh...!

Uhm... uhm...

Aah...!

[ slurps]

Mmhmm...

You're
a crazy person!

I should have
expected this

after the way
you stole that balloon!

Did I, Patrick, did I?

Or did your criminal mind
hypnotize me to steal it?!

Ohh...!

That's it!

Aah... ohho...!

First the balloon,
now my candy bar...

you're out of control!

I'm...

I'm telling on you.

[ gasps]

Not if I tell
on you first!

I'll beat you there!

[ huffing and panting]

You're going to
get in trouble!

No, you... you are!

[ huffing and panting...]

[ talking simultaneously, 
panting]:
He... I... and I...
and the balloon...

And the, and the...
uh, uh... boom... I...

What can I do for you, boys?

BOTH:
We stole a balloon!

[ crying...]

PATRICK:
I'm no good.

SPONGEBOB:
We stole a balloon!

What's the problem?

It appears these two
stole a balloon.

What are you
going to do to us?

[ whispers]

Okay, follow me.

If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime.

Okay, time's up.

Now get out!

B... but we stole
a balloon!

Yeah...
on Free Balloon Day.

[ both laughing...]

How about some lollipops
for the road, boys?

Let's vow never to
borrow anything

without permission
again.

You said it!

All right... which one of you
flatfoots stole my lollipop?

[ all laughing]

SPONGEBOB:
Oh brother!

[ laughter continues]

PATRICK:
I mean it.

Oh! Hi!

I'm Patchy the Pirate

president of the
SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club!

Oh!

Hey, that's better.

Squawk!

Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

That's right, Potty.

It isChristmas.

And there ain't nothing better
in the seven seas

than a Bikini Bottom Christmas.

It sure is
a magical time of year.

Why I'll bet old SpongeBob

is gearing up for Santa Claus
right now!

I sure am!

[ clanking]

[ buzzing]

I'm ready!

[ laughing]

Not bad for a creature

with no vertebrae.

And I'm sure our pal Patrick

is doing his share

of the decorating.

I, too, am also
preparing for Christmas.

Mmm, unbaked cookie dough!

[ squawks]

Potty want cookie dough!

Huh? Oh!

Cookie!

Potty, no!

Get out of here!

Potty...

Ah, give us a lick.

Back off,
you flying freak.

[ squawks]
Clarify, please.

This here cookie dough
is for the children

not for pesky parrots.

[ bell dings]

What's that?

Three bells.

We all know
what three bells means.

Free ice cream!

[ laughs]

No, you silly livers.

No!

[ squawks]
Man overboard?

You I'm ignoring.

No...

It's time to open fan letters!

Oh, thank you, Potty.

Okay, Potty, thank you.

Come on, give it,
you birdbrain!

[ squawking...]

Quiet, you infernal bird!

[ squawks]

Hmm!

This letter comes to us from...

Name and address withheld.

And he writes:

"Dear SpongeBob

"I am ten years old

"and I was wondering if you like
Christmas as much as I do.

Sincerely yours..."

Name and address withheld.

A very good question.

But you know, they didn't
always celebrate Christmas
in Bikini Bottom.

Squawk!
They didn't?

No, sir, my finefeathered
little neck pain!

[ squawks]

Whoa!

There was a time
when no one had even heard
of Christmas in Bikini Bottom.

Hey, who wants to hear
the story of SpongeBob's
very first Christmas?

[ weakly]:
Squawk...

Potty?

[ foghorn sounds]

You ate all me
cookie dough!

Sqouch...

Oh, well,
on with the show.

[ laughs]

Today I'm going sneak up

and get that Sandy with
a supersneaky karate move.

[ karateyelling]:
Hoo... ha!

Hoo, heehee!

Whoo... hi!

[ humming "Jingle Bells"]

What diabolical act
is she committing now?

Fire!

Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming!

[ imitating siren]

Stand back, Sandy!

Fire!

Huh?

So, I guess
there's no fire?

What in the name
of the Alamo

is wrong with you,
SpongeBob?

Ain't you never seen

a Christmas tree before?

Christmas who?

What?!

Y'all never heard of Christmas?

Is she a friend
from Texas?

[ laughing]:
No!

I can't believe y'all
haven't heard about...

Christmas.

Tell me more about this...

Christmas.

Patchy: 
And so Sandy wove 
a magical tale

of gumdrops and penny whistles.

She told of toymaking elves 
and flying reindeer.

But best of all she told of 
the one they call...

Santa Claus.

...and everyone pretends
to like the fruitcake.

Yawn.

But the best part is
you can write a letter

to this guy Santa Claus
and tell him what you want

and he brings it to you.

Just like a genie!

[ laughs]

I don't know
about you lubbers

but any fella who's
giving away free stuff

is a friend o' mine.

That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.

Here you go: you can get started
on your letter.

I can't believe anybody
would celebrate a holiday

where a jolly prowler
breaks into your house
and leaves gifts.

Like a genie.

Pipe down, Squidward!

I'm trying to concentrate.

This things as good
as a blank check

direct from
the First National Bank

of Santa Claus.

Ah, brother.

Yeah...

Okay, who's next?

Ooh, ooh, me, me!

Here you go, Patrick.

There's no words
on this paper.

Not yet.

Yippee!

A writing stick!

Come on, Squidward,
write a letter.

SpongeBob,
grow up, will you?

No one's going to
give me a gift

just because I write
them a stupid letter.

[ rip]

SpongeBob,
I ripped my paper.

Could I have
another one?

Sure, buddy, here you go.

Okeydokey, Squid...

[ rip]

...ward.

Uh, SpongeBob?

Thanks.

"Dear... San..."

Oh, not again!

Here, Patrick, watch me.

"Dear Santa...

"What do I want
for Christmas, you may ask?

"All I want if for you
to visit the gentle folk
here in Bikini Bottom.

That is my wish."

Patrick, I designed
this mechanism

to shoot bottles
to the surface.

The hopes of everyone rest

on the success
of its maiden voyage.

Fire in the hole!

Patrick:
Santa!

Where's Santa?

He doesn't come
till Christmas Eve.

Okay, boy,
my demands...

er, uh, I mean letter,
is ready to go.

Great, Mr. Krabs.

What did you wish for?

A pony.

Really?

With saddle bags
full of money!

Here you go, SpongeBob.

What did you wish for,
Patrick?

Another piece of paper.

And what did you wish for,
little girl?

Front teeth.

I could use a new hat.

I need a new hairstyle.

Another glass of water
for my teeth.

Excuse me, coming through,
out of the way.

Great, Squidward,
you finished.

What's your wish?

My wish is that the
people of Bikini Bottom

will stop
paying any attention
to the inane drivel

that is constantly
streaming out of this
dunderhead's mouth.

Gee, Squidward

maybe Santa will
bring me a dictionary

so I can understand
what you just said.

Okay, everybody,
we've got a lot to do

now that we've
summoned Santa Claus.

We must ready ourselves
for his arrival.

All:
Hooray!

[ together]:
It's shaping up to be
a wonderful holiday

Not your normal
average everyday

Sounds like someone felled
my old coral tree

SpongeBob, Patrick,
why'd you do this to me?

The world feels like
it's in loverly

Go away
before I harm you bodily

This Christmas feels like
the very first Christmas to me

There'll be shopping,
decorating and plenty of snow

Hey, Patrick,
who's that under

the mistletoe?

The mistletoe♪

What, who me?

Would you look at the time,
I should go!

People seem
a little more brotherly

Brotherly♪

Here's a
special something
to you from me

To you from me♪

Even all the trash, on
Christmas it smells so sweetly

This Christmas feels like
the very first Christmas to me

Lalala, lalalalala

Lalala,
lalalalala

Lalala,
lalalalala

Lalala,

What do you want?

Can't you see
that I'm busy?

Step outside, we've got
something for you to see

SpongeBob, take this stuff
down immediately

Chestnuts roasting and
burns in the third degree

Tonight things are as good
as they seem to be

A star on top will
complete all the scenery

This Christmas feels like
the very first Christmas to me

[ Krabs chortles]

This Christmas feels like the
very first Christmas to me.

Is Squidward right?

Can there be a Christmas
under the sea?

Stay tuned.

Whoa....

It's about time you got back!

Now I can finish me story.

So, SpongeBob was sending

the last of the letters
to Santa...

I hope he can
read Portuguese.

Ah... well, that's
the last letter.

[ gasps] Wait!

Squidward hasn't written
his letter yet!

Squidward, hurry!

Squidward!

Squidward, hurry!

[ record playing clarinet solo]

SpongeBob,
what are you doing?

Don't worry, Squidward,
I'll help you get started.

"Dear Santa Claus...."

SpongeBob, forget it.

Right, too formal.

"Hi, Santa."

SpongeBob, no!

"Howdy, Claus"?

I'm not
writing a letter

to a figment
of your imagination.

But, Squidward,
when Santa comes

you'll be the only one
without a gift.

SpongeBob, how many times
do I have to say it?

I don't believe in Santa Claus!

Come on, Squid, all you
have to do is write a letter.

What have you got to lose?

My selfrespect.

My sanity.

My lunch.

Squidward, come on!

Come on,
Squidward!

Don't be
a party pooper!

Come on out!

Santa Claus is a big phony!

SpongeBob has
got you all fooled!

Come on, Squidward!

[ crowd clamoring]

Drop the whole
antiChristmas thing!

Hmm, those idiots are
going to be up all night

while I get
a full night's sleep.

Oh, Santa's coming
tonight, tonight

Santa's coming tonight

Santa's coming

Hey, where's Santa?

Uh, he should be here
any minute.

Santa's coming
tonight, tonight

Santa's coming...

Oh, forget this!

[ all grumbling...]

Thanks for the lies,
Mr. Fairytale.

Let's go waste our time
somewhere else.

Hey, guys, where's
your Christmas spirit?

He's just running late.

He probably just
stopped for a snack.

Fat guys get hungry,
right?

Yeah!

Never trust a genie.

[ alarm clock rings]

Squidward:
Morning already?

Oh, boy!

Merry Christmas!

Hohoho!

[ laughing]

Merry Christmas!

Wait!

Oh, I see

a great Christmas photo op.

Can you move in a little?

Say "Santa Claus."

[ tearfully]:
Santa Claus...

Aw...

Our first Christmas.

This Christmas feels like
the very first Christmas

[ donkey braying...]The first Christmas
is this Christmas

Oh, it feels like
the first Christmas to me.

[ laughing]

You were right, Squidward.

This is a stupid holiday.

[ crying]

[ sniffles]

I still want you to have this.

What... what's this?

A present.

I made it for you

so you wouldn't feel
left out when...

Santa came!

[ sobbing]

Oh, gee, you know, I...

You're welcome.

[ crying...]

SpongeBob?

He made me a present?

It's probably a jellyfish net.

Or an old Krabby Patty.

Or...

[ goofy voice]:
his favorite underpants.

Present, ha!

What?

Why, it looks like a clarinet.

[ sniffing]

It smells like one, too.

Handcrafted out of driftwood.

And it's even got my name on it.

What's this?

[ playing "Dance 
of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

Wow!

This is the greatest gift
I have ever gotten.

[ sniffles]

Oh, I feel like a...

I feel like a...
I feel like a...

[ donkey braying]

Big jerk!

What have I done
to poor SpongeBob?

Uh, hey, SpongeBob, uh...

SpongeBob?

[ sadly]:
I guess I won't be needing this.

Oh...

That's better.

[ thunder rumbles, crackles]

The poor little guy.

All he wanted was
to spread a little joy.

I better get this stuff
off of Squid's place.

Squidward:
Hohoho! Hohoho!

Huh? Hello?

Who's there?

Huh? Hello?

Hohoho! Hohoho!

Hello? Yes?
Who's there?

Huh? Hello?

Show yourself.

Whoohoo! Hello?

Who is it? Huh?

Up here, you dunce!

I mean, uh...
Merry Christmas, little boy!

[ gasps]

Could... could it be?

Yes, it is I, Santa Claus!

Hohoho...

hoo, heh, huh, ooh!

Hey, you're...

Sssan... Sssan...

Sssan...

Hey, uh, kid?

Take it easy.

Sssan... ta!

SpongeBob.

SpongeBob.

SpongeBob!

Ssssan...

Don't do that again.

I knew you'd
make it, Santa!

Hey, Santa, where's
your big, round belly?

Well, uh, that, um,
is a result of, uh...

undersea pressure
on my body.

Where's your reindeer
and your flying machine?

Uh, I loaned them
to the Easter bunny.

And what about
that nose?

I knew you were
supposed to have
a big one

but that thing's
gigantic.

[ laughs]

All right, I'm Santa!

Santa!

This is the greatest gift
you could have given me.

Thank you for bringing Christmas
to Bikini Bottom.

I didn't bring Christmas
to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob.

Youdid.

I did?

Oh...

[ meows]

Merry Christmas,
SpongeBob!

Merry Christmas!

Phew! I'm glad that's over.

Do you have a present
for me, Santa?

Uh, well, uh, see, I'm not,
I'm not really...

SpongeBob:
Oh, go ahead,
Santa Claus.

See, he is real.

He made my Christmas wish
come true.

He won't let you down.

Uh, right,
just a second.

Okay, quickly, let's see.

What do little girls like?

Um, a book of matches
or a shaving kit?

A copy of my birth certificate?

There's got to be something
around here.

Think, think, think!

Ah, perfect!

Here you go,
little girl.

Hohoho!

[ giggles]

Thanks, Santa.

That almost felt good.

[ clears throat]

Uh... who...?

Hey, Santa,
where's my present?

And mine?

And what about me?

Uh... let's see what Santa has
for all you good people.

Think fast, Santa.

Gifts for the people.

Aha!

A bowl of mashed potatoes
for you.

Thank you, Santa, this
is just what I wanted.

A new hairstyle.

Thanks, Santa.

Here you go, Patrick.

Whoa...!

A wristwatch!

Thank you, Santa!

What was I thinking?

I gave away all my stuff

just so SpongeBob
wouldn't be sad.

Am I insane?

[ knock on door]

You might as well take the door.

That's all that's left.

Squidward,
you missed him!

He was here,
just like I said!

He gave us
all presents!

He was jolly and
he had a beard.

His nose was big
and he had rosy cheeks.

He was friendly
and kind and Santaish.

Oh, his belly was small

but his nose was huge
with Christmas joy...

Well, at least it's over.

Huh?

What's this?

Santa:
"Dear Squidward

"Thanks for all your help!

"You've been a real good boy
this year!

Warm regards, Santa Claus."

Hohohoho!

Hohoho!

Hohohohohohohoho...

Merry Christmas!

Hohohohohohoho...

Hohohohohohohoho...

Wow, Patrick...
[ sniffles]

That was beautiful.

What? I was just reading
this candy wrapper, see?

[ pop]

[ gasps]

Patrick!

Put your helmet
back on!

You know there's no water
at Sandy's house!

It's okay, SpongeBob.

This stuff iswater! Look!

I guess you're right.

It's okay here.

Take it off.

No one's looking.

[ both whoop and cheer]

[ both whoop and cheer]

[ loud snoring]

SpongeBob,
did you hear that?

SPONGEBOB:
I think it came
from up in Sandy's tree.

[ snoring continues...]

That is one tired tree.

Let's check it out.

[ gasps]

Look what's
in Sandy's bed!

Looks like an
overinflated Sandy doll.

I think this thing 
isSandy.

Hibernation
must mean

the opposite
of beauty sleep.

[ snoring]

[ muttering]:
I've had enough of your
dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan.

I'm gonna get you and your
partner, Pinhead Larry

or my name ain't
Sheriff Sandy...

[ snoring]

She must be dreaming
about Texas outlaws.

[ both giggling]

Look out, Sandy.

I'm Dirty Dan.

I'm gonna catch you

and throw in jail
at taxpayers' expense.

Ooh, you better
run faster, Sandy.

Yeah, I'm
getting away!

Run faster!

Hurry, we're getting
in a taxi!

Faster, faster!

[ stifling giggles]

I'll get you two.

You're nothing but pure evil!

Just like newspaper comics.

[ snoring]

[ giggling]

[ whispers]:
Come on, Patrick.

We shouldn't
disturb her anymore.

That's not disturbing.

This is disturbing.

[ grunts]

Hi, there, SpongeBob.

My name is Patback.

Ha! That is
really disturbing.

[ both laughing loudly]

[ laughter 
continues]

[ laughing]

Uh, SpongeBob?

Huh?

[ growling]

[ roars]

[ screams]
[ screams]

Faster, SpongeBob!

She's gaining on us!

Sandy, no! Stop!

I warned you, Dirty Dan!

Now you just crossed the border
into Hurtville!

Sandy, it's us, your friends
SpongeBob and Patrick!

Please, Sandy, I can't
afford dry cleaning.

Gonna skin ya and make a pair
of size six... boots.

[ snoring...]

Fun's over.

Whoo... we sure
don't want to

wake her up again.

Too bad
we don't have

any earplugs
to put on her.

Yeah, all's I got is
this belly button lint.

All right, Pat!

[ muttering]:
I'm gonna rip your arms off

and flapjacks...
[ snoring]

Well, that
ought to work.

Hey, Sandy, does it work?!

[ snoring...]

Hey, Sandy, if you can't
hear us, don't say anything!

Hey, Sandy!

Don't wake up!

[ both laughing]

See you later,
Sheriff Sandy!

[ laughing]

[ both laughing]

[ drawling]:
You're under arrest!

[ drawling]:
You'll never catch me!

[ laughs]

[ laughs]

[ boom]

[ laughs]

Hey, that's
not fair!

Cowboys couldn't
afford cannons.

They couldn't afford
station wagons, either.

Nice paneling.

All right, Pinhead.

Your time is up.

Who you calling Pinhead?

I want to be Dirty Dan.

What makes you think
you can be Dirty Dan?

I'm dirty... bleah!

I'd say I'm Dirty Dan.

I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!

Oh!

Guh!

I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!
Oh!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ee!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ee!

I'm Dirty Dan! Oh!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ee!

I'm Dirty Dan! Oh!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ee!

I'm Dirty Dan! Oh!

I'm Dirty Dan! Ee!

I'm Dirty Dan! Oh!

I'm Dirty Dan!

[ screams]

Screaming will get you no...

[ growling]

Which one of you fellers
is the real Dirty Dan?!

Uh... I am?

[ screaming]

Patrick!

[ crash]

Hot wings...

Okay, Pinhead Larry.

Now you get yours!

[ screams]

Pinhead...!

[ whimpering]

[ panting]

[ whimpering]

[ panting]

[ panting and whimpering]

Aah! Whoa...

Whoahoho!

Now you're gonna pay for
those crimes, Pinhead!

Sandy, stand back.

I'm warning ya!

[ roars]

Okay, I warned ya!

[ grunts]

Did you win?

[ grunts]

[ gurgling]

Hi, SpongeBob.

[ growls, snarls]

[ both scream]

[ Sandy snoring...]

[ bell tolls]

Okay, SpongeBob,
you can be Dirty Dan.

I just want to be
Patrick.

Let's get
out of here

before Sandy
wakes up again!

[ gasping and panting]

[ grunting]

Ouch!

Sorry, Patrick,
but the door is slippery.

It's frozen shut!

Let me have a try.

[ spits]

Open, Sesame!

Well, I've done
all I can do.

Then we're stuck in here...

until the door thaws...

in spring.

Barnacles!

[ chattering]

Is it spring yet?

Nnno...

I'm so cccold
that I'm shivering.

[ cracking]

II'm so cold that I can use
my nose drippings

as a pair of chopsticks.

II'm so ccold that...

I'm shivering!

Maybe we should build
a fire.

I've got it!

We'll burn the bark
from Sandy's tree.

[ Sandy snoring]

You're gonna be
wearing an iron lung

when I'm through
with you, Pinhead.

[ whimpers]

The fire's not going to
happen, Patrick.

I don't get it!

How does Sandy survive these
intense conditions every year?

Maybe she just ignores it.

Maybe...

Maybe...

Maybe it's her fur!

[ chattering]

BOTH:
Yeah!

[ snoring...]

Look at all that warm,
toasty fur.

PATRICK:
It's like a gold mine,
but with fur.

Carefully...

Carefully...

Come on, do it!

I'm freezing here!

All right, all right,
hang on a second!

[ roars]

[ snoring...]

That should be enough,
right?

Sponge, I'm a big man.

A big, big man!

Well, I guess I've lived
a full life.

[ roars]

[ snoring]

This is taking too long!

I want the warm now!

Pat, no!

[ roaring]

[ sighs]

Pat, are you crazy?

No... I'm warm.

Let me see that roll of tape.

[ tape rips fur]

[ roaring]

[ tape rips fur]

[ roaring]

[ tape rips fur]

[ roaring]

[ tape rips fur]

[ roaring]

Man, that fur really
hits the spot!

No more frozen armpits.

And this eyebrow/goatee combo
works like a charm.

This the best idea
we've ever had.

You said it!

I'm ready for the longest,
coldest winter ever.

BOTH:
Bring it on!

[ birds chirping]

Spring?

[ Sandy yawning]

Wow...

Spring already.

PATRICK:
Oh, oh...!

Tartar sauce!

The lock is still frozen!

I sure can't wait to get
outside and warm my fur.

[ puffing]

Oh, look, it's SpongeBob
and Patrick.

[ Patrick screaming]

Hi, guys!

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

It's okay, Sandy.

Squirrel pattern
baldness

is quite common
in small mammals.

SpongeBob...

Patrick...

Don't worry, Sandy.

We've got you covered.

[ chuckles]

[ Sandy chuckles]

More lemonade, boys?

BOTH:
Thanks, Sandy!

Spring sure is lovely.

[ SpongeBob laughing]

Oh, I've got you now, Gary.

[ meows]

Tag, you're it!

[ laughing]

[ garbled]:
Gary will never find me here!

Uhoh.

[ meows]

Tag! Now I'm it!

[ laughing]

Hi, SpongeBob.

What are you doing?

Gary and I are
playing tag.

You want to join us?

Oh, boy, would I?!

Okay...

Tag... you're it!

I'm it! I'm it!

I'm it! I'm it!
I'm it! I'm it!

[ meows]

Tag, you're it!

I win! I win!

[ purring]

What's with Gary?

He sounds like
a motorboat.

[ laughing]

That's just a snail's way
of saying he likes you.

[ laughing]

Tickles!

[ laughing]

[ both laughing]

[ still laughing]

Well, I guess it's time

for me and the Gar Bear
to get going.

Come on, Gary.

[ pop]

Boy, I can't wait
to hit the hay.

How about you, Gary? Gary?

Gary?

Brush, brush, brush

Brush, brush, brush...

Hey, Patrick,
have you seen Gary?

Brush, brush, brush

Brushing everywhere...

[ spits]

Nope..
oh, hey, here he is.

[ purring]

[ meows]

Come on, Gary.

We've got to let
Patrick go to sleep.

I don't mind, SpongeBob.

In fact, why don't you let Gary
sleep over at my house tonight?

Hey, that's a great idea.

A sleepover, oh, boy!

Oh, this is going
to be great, Gary.

We can stay up till dawn
and watch scary movies

and eat popcorn
and play board games...

Blah, blah, blah...

Gee, this great.

My two best friends in the 
whole sea having a sleepover.

And then we'll make
a house of cards

and then we'll read
some comic books...

Okay, you guys
have a good time.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah...

[ crickets chirping]

[ foghorn blows]

I'm awake!

PATRICK:
Hey, SpongeBob!

Hey, guys, how
was the sleepover?

Great, SpongeBob.

Watch this!

No matter where I go,
Gary follows.

[ pop]

[ laughing]

[ meows]

[ laughing]

[ laughing]

[ meows]

See?

Come on, Gary!

Try and catch...

me!

[ laughing]

Isn't this great, Gary?

Me running around
and you chasing me.

You're not chasing me.

Come on, Gary.

Let's go play
a different game.

Whoahohoho!

Look out, I'm right
in front of... you.

What's wrong with me?

[ sniffs]

Do I offend?

[ purring][ laughing]

Hey, Gary!

Gary, look!

It's your favorite ball!

[ purring][ laughing]

[ laughing]

Hey, Gary!

Look...

Snailnip!

Huh? Huh, huh?

[ laughing...]

Help! Gary, help!

Help me!

Oh, merciful Neptune!

I closed the window on my head!

[ laughing][ purring]

All right, that's it!

[ screams]

[ laughing]

Oh, ooh...

Gary, you stop this
foolishness right now.

Gary the Snail, answer me
when I'm talking to you.

Okay, that's it,
mister.

You are coming home with
me right this instant!

[ grunting]

Say goodbye to
Patrick, Gary.

[ meows]

Hold it right there,
DadMom AngryPants.

What's that supposed to mean?

I don't know.

But I do know Gary knows
who he wants to go with.

Now, I suggest you put him down
and let him choose.

Fine, but I would
like to remind him

who it was that fed
him and housed him

and sat at his bedside
when he was sick

and massaged
his eyestalks

when his eyes
were sore!

Okay, Gary, go ahead,
show him.

Okay, Gary, come to me!

Come on,
come on, Gary!

Come on,
come here, Gary.

Oh, uh,
wrong way, Gary.

GGary, turn around.

Gary, turn around.

Gary, no,
Gary, no, no, no.

No, don't do it,
Gary.

No, Gary...

Well, well, well...

I guess that answers
that question.

So long, SpongeBob.

Gary and me
got stuff to do.

Okay, fine!

If that's the way
you want to thank me...

[ crying]:
for all that I've done.

[ sniffling]

I guess you're not
coming back, Gary.

[ sniffles]

I don't need Gary!

I'll just find another pet.

Yeah, it will be
better than Gary.

I'm going to get a pet

who won't go off
with my best friend!

[ laughing...]

Hi, guys!

[ panting]

Say hello to
my new pal Rex.

[ barks]

Not only
is he loyal

but he knows
tricks, too.

Watch and learn.

Sit, Rex, sit!

Roll over, Rex,
roll over!

Now stay, Rex, stay!

Good boy, Rex.

Who's a good boy?

Who's a good boy?

Who's a good boy?

[ Patrick laughs]

[ laughing...]

I'm sure glad we went
our separate ways, Gary.

A worm really is the pet for me.

So loyal, so trusting!

Always by my side!

[ barks]

Who needs worms anyway?

Welcome home,
newest best friend.

Come on out,
don't be shy.

[ giggles]

You remind me of someone
I once knew.

A certain someone

whose name will
not be mentioned

in this household.

Come on, let me
show you around...

Larry.

Meow.

And now, Larry, I present
to you... dinner time!

Tada!

Bon appétit, Larry!

[ chuckles]

[ sniffs]

[ hisses]

Okay... maybe later.

This is where
you sleep, Larry.

[ snarling]

Uh, that's where I...

[ hissing]

[ snoring]

I guess you can sleep...
there.

I'll sleep down here.

Well, goodnight, Larry.

[ hisses]

[ crickets chirping]

[ gulls cawing]

[ television playing]

Hey, hey, Larry!

Want to hear a joke?

Oh, Gary used to love this one.

[ clears throat]

What do you call
a snail on a ship?

A snailor!

[ laughs]

[ hisses]

Don't you get it, Larry?

A... a snailor.

Gosh, Larry sure is
different than Gary.

And Gary and Larry
are real different than...

Jerry.

Oh, Gary, why did you
have to go?

[ sobbing]:
Why, Gary... why?

Why, why, why, why, why?

[ Gary meows]

[ gasps]

Gary?

Hey, SpongeBob.

Oh...
hello, Patrick.

[ meows]

Hello... Gary.

Would it be all right

if Gary and I did some
laundry over here?

Laundry?

But we used to do laundry.

And, uh, SpongeBob?

Could we borrow
some soap?

Soap? But we used to
use soap.

Do you want...

fresh scent or heavy... du...

Here it comes.

Du... du... du... ty!

Gary!

Please come back,
Gary!

Please come home!

I'm a wreck without you!

I know!

If you come back

there will be
a norules rule.

You can do
whatever you want
when you want.

If you feel like ripping up
the sofa, rip it up!

And the litter box?

Forget about it!

The world is your litter box!

And you don't have to
wait around

for me to feed you anymore!

24hour fridge access!

And you don't even have to
use a bowl!

I know how much you like

my prized driftwood carving
of Squidward.

Well, think of it as your own
personal scratching post.

What do you think, Gary?
Won't it be fun, Gary?

How pathetic.

Gary...

I'm sorry, SpongeBob,
but Gary's with me now.

You had your chance
and you failed.

You have to stop
living in the past.

Face it, SpongeBob.

You're only
hurting yourself.

It's what Gary wants

and what Gary wants,
is me.

Right, Gary?

Huh?

He only liked me
for my shorts!

No, Patrick!

He wanted the cookie
in your pocket!

[ meows]

GGGary?

[ burps]

[ meows]

Whee!

Aw, Gary, I knew
you'd never leave me!

Aw...
[ chuckles]

Let's go for a walk, pal.

Gary?

I thought what we had
was special...!

NARRATOR:
Here we are again at the
Bikini Bottom Boating School.

Today is once again the day of
SpongeBob's boating school exam

but more importantly, this is
the last test for the year

and if SpongeBob does not
pass this one

it means another whole year 
of boating school!

[ crash, glass breaks]

[ groaning]

Wha' happen?

Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.

You just struck
another pedestrian.

Minus 20 more points.

How many do I have?

Negative 224.

How many more minutes
left in the test?

The test is over.

That's enough time!

I can make up
those points!

No... SpongeBob!

Wait! You didn't hear me

[ screams]

It's too late! SpongeBob!

[ coughing]

Okay, Mrs. Puff,
what's my final score?

Six.

Whoo!

And how many
do I need to pass?

Six.

Ooh...

Hundred.

Wha...?

Six hundred.

You need 600 to pass.

You got six.

Don't worry.

I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff.

Besides...

This means I get to
be in your class

for a whole
'nother year!

Well, see you
next Tuesday.

Yeah!

I'm gonna get
my driver's license

and it's only gonna take
one more year, one more year

One more superduper year

One more superspectacular

extramagical,
extrafantastical year...

[ thinking]: 
Oh, Neptune.

Another year with him!

Barnacles!

Dirty barnacles!

I've got to do something 
to save myself.

Oh... there's only one way out.

A teacher's ace in the hole.

Extra credit!

What was that, Mrs. Puff?

Extra credit, SpongeBob.

The extra credit.

[ laughing wildly]

I still have a chance.

I, I mean,
you still have a chance.

What's extra credit?

It's when you get credit

for the things you weren't
able to do before.

Oh...

Now, are we ready
for that extra credit?

Extra credit!

That's the spirit.

So, all you have to do

to earn your extra credit
and pass my class

and never have to come 
anywhere near this school again

is write a tenword sentence

on what you've learned
in boating school.

But I've learned so many things.

Just pick one,
I don't care which.

Here, I'll help you
get started.

"What I learned
in boating school is..."

There! That's already
seven words!

Only three more!

LEAR...

[ pencil breaks]

Oh, barnacles!

What's wrong?

Got to sharpen my pencil.

[ whistling]

Hmm...

[ humming...]

Hmm?

[ singing...]

NE...
[ pencil snaps]

Oh!

[ whistling]

Give me that!
Here's a pen.

A pen! One of the most permanent
of all writing utensils.

Gonna write an essay

That's what I say.

There.

Fantastic! Let me see it.

No, wait, I changed my mind!

I'm sure it's fine.

Just let me see.

No, don't look!

It's not ready.

It's so simple!

Only ten words!

"What I learned
in boating school is..."

Blankety... blankety... blank!

I can do this. I can do this!

"What I learned
in boating school is..."

"What I learned
in boating school is...!"

I can do this, I can do this!

Aah, aah... is it hot
in here, Mrs. Puff?!

Why is it so hot in here?!

Aah! My hand!
My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff!

Make it stop!

You only need
three... more...
words!

[ grunts]

Okay... let me see
what you've written.

It's not ready yet.

That's okay, SpongeBob.

Show the teacher
what you've written.

No!

Give it to me!

No!

Let me see it!

"What I learned
in boating school is..."

Uh...

Well, the rest doesn't matter.

You pass! [ laughs]

You pass!

Mrs. Puff, I don't feel
like I really did anything.

That's how extra credit
is supposed to feel.

Really?

Besides, here's
your license.

My license!

It tastes just like
I dreamt it would.

Mrs. Puff, I...

Thank you, SpongeBob.

Congratulations.

Have a nice life.

Look out, Bikini Bottom!

There's a new driver
on the road

and his name is...

SpongeBob SquarePants!

[ echoes]: 
SpongeBob SquarePants!

SpongeBob SquarePants!

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la,
la, la, la...

Aah!

Ooh, ow...!

La, la, la, la,
la, la, la...

Ouch.

ALL:
Happy birthday!

La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[ thumping and grunting]

So much destruction.

This reporter asks why.

Local consensus places the blame

on this negligent,
selfish driving instructor

who... oh!

La, la, la, la,
la, la, la...

Let's... not... use that take.

That's preposterous.

He did the extra credit.

[ laughs nervously]

There's no need to worry.

He doesn't even have
a boat to drive.

Now to go home and have
the rest of that pasta.

[ chuckles]

Aah!

ALL:
Surprise!

To the greatest
teacher ever!

Thank you,
Mrs. Puff.

I know I speak
for everyone

when I say that
we consider you

a member of
the SquarePants family.

[ kissing...]

I think you've made
your point, dear.

Ahem.

Mrs. Puff, we were
starting to think

SpongeBob was
never going to
get his license.

But you never
gave up on him.

You never quit.

You never took
the easy way out.

Well, I, uh... okay.

We wanted to make sure
Mrs. Puff

the greatest driving
teacher in the world

was here to see this.

See what?

Tada!

"IM RDY."

BOTH:
A brand new boatmobile?!

For me...?

Oh...

Don't worry, Mrs. Puff.

He'll be driving by tomorrow!
Toodleoo!

What have I done?

Everyone will know

that I let him slide
through school.

I'll have to move
to a new city

start a new boating school
with a new name.

No... not again.

I've got to end this thing
before it begins.

[ crickets chirping]

You took quite
a buster there, son.

What I learned
in boating school today is...!

We're going to have to
hold off

on the driving there
for a while, son.

That's right, honey.

Now, just stay in bed.

And no going
near the boat.

[ door closes]

Hi, Boaty.

[ squeaks]

[ gasps]
Boaty, you're cold!

Take my socks.

Oh, Boaty, I'm always
going to take care of you.

You're the best boat
in the deep blue sea.

[ kisses]

[ sighs]

[ rattling...]

I hope I still remember
how to do this.

Yeah...

[ starts engine]

[ SpongeBob snoring...]

Hey, I'm driving!

[ both scream]

[ grunting]

Who are you and what
are you doing in my boat?

And why are you wearing
that ski mask?!

Because you're not skiing!

Oh, my gosh, I know who you are!

No, you don't!

You don't know who I am.

Yes, I do!

I know that you're...

a boatjacker!

I never thought I'd have to
use this pepper spray.

[ screams]

Somebody help me!

Somebody help me...!

Sorry, SpongeBob, but
it was for your own good.

[ panting]

Give me back my boat!

[ panting...]

Ay... yi... yi...!

You'd better stop this boat!

[ grunts]

I'm... not... letting... go!

Nothing will stop me!

Not even... [ gasps]

Giant clams?!

[ snapping and yelling]

I'm... not... letting go...
even for... [ gasps]

Cheese graters?! No!

Ouch... no... no... no...
ow... oh... oh...

If... you think I'll let go
for a little...

Educational television?!

Oh, no!

[ screams]

Looks like that
got rid of him.

Now for some tunes.

[ static]

And now back to KRUD

with all of your personal

"You won't get away with
stealing my car!" hits.

[ screaming]

[ grunting, 
tires squealing...]

Hey, look.

[ engine revs]

[ both screaming]

Oof, oof...

Argh!

I'd never let you
have this boat.

Not even if you were...
[ gasps]

Mrs. Puff?

[ flapping lips]

[ engine revs]

[ siren wails]

So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?

Uh, SpongeBob.

I'd like to... apologize.

I shouldn't have passed you.

You really weren't ready.

So, I guess I got to give
my license back, huh?

I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting
a new class Monday morning.

You kidding? You're the only
teacher for this student.

And besides, the warden says
she'll let you go early

if you do her a favor.

What's that?

Free driving lessons!

[ laughing...]

SPONGEBOB:
Wow! I can't believe it!

We're actually here at the
biannual Jellyfish Convention!

PATRICK:
Jellyfish are awesome!

Cool stateoftheart
jellyfish nets!

Touch.

Don't touch.

Wow! The harpoon from 
Jellyfish: The Movie!

Touch.

Don't touch!

Look! Dr. Manowar!

The guy who got stung
by Big Lenny and lived.

And now it only hurts
when you touch it.

[ screams]

Touch.

Do I have to follow
you all day?

[ SpongeBob screams]

Patrick, look!

Can it be?!

Ice cream?

No, it's
The Jellyspotters

Bikini Bottom's premiere
jellyfish enthusiasts club!

Aah! And their leader...

the coolest jellyfish
enthusiast ever...

Kevin the Sea Cucumber!

What's so great
about a nerdy pickle?

If I could just
touch the hem of
his pocket protector

then maybe some
of his greatness
would rub off on me.

SpongeBob, as a friend,
I must say that's really geeky.

[ gasps]

Oh, my gosh!

Jeffrey Jellyfish!

Wait, Jeffrey!

I have to touch you!

Hey!

Bamboo?

I only use composite materials
in my net handle.

ALL:
Composite materials...

Next question.

ALL:
Next question...

Uh... hi, Kevin.

Hi. What is your question?

Hi, Kevin.

Whatever.

Next question, please?

Hi, Kevin.

Hello, loser.

All right, you,
way in the back.

Hi, Kevin...

Does anyone here
have an actual...

[ SpongeBob breathing loudly]

Hi, Kevin.

I'm your biggest fan.

You're too kind.
Security!

No, wait!

I would do anything for you!

Why don't you go
jump off a building?

Huh?

[ screaming...]

[ crash]

Anything...

Punch yourself in the face.

Doesn't that hurt you?

Do you want it
to hurt me, Kevin?

[ laughs]

[ others laugh]

That is the best!

[ all laughing]

This guy's great!

We have got to bring this guy
jellyfishing with us.

No, Kevin, no.
He's a geek.

[ whispers]:
Look, I won't let the guy
join the club.

I just want to see how many
times he can get stung

before he goes running home
like a baby.

Meepmeep.
Kevin's a genius.

ALL:
Meepmeep...
genius... Kevin...

Hey, kid...

How would you like to try out
for The Jellyspotters?

[ steady tone]

Clear.

[ zap]

I'd love it!

[ SpongeBob imitating car]

Ah... nothing like driving
through jellyfish fields

with the top down,
eh, Jellyspotters?

OTHERS:
Meep... top down... top down...
meep... top down... meep...

[ sighs]

Well, here we are.

Jellyfish Fields.

Oh... ow!

I hope you didn't
forget our nets.

I didn't forget them, Kevin!

They're in the trunk!

I can't believe I'm here
with The Jellyspotters!

All my life I wanted to be
a Jellyspotter

and now I'm here with you
with the nets and the jars

and I'm with Kevin and
we're all with each other
and we're jellyfishing...

Hold it!

Before you become
a Jellyspotter

you have to pass
a rigorous test.

Meep... rigorous test...
[ laughing]

Quiet! Shh!

Your first test?

Catch a jellyfish.

[ buzzing]

Hey, I caught one!

Am I a
Jellyspotter now?

Meep...
he caught one...
in the club... meep.

Uh, that doesn't count.

[ zapping]Ouch!

Whawhawha...

I meant twojellyfish.

Two jellyfish... meep...
in the net... meep...

Ooh... that's not
what I meant!

I meant 20 jellyfish!

Oh. Let's see...

One, two, three...

Oh...
[ grunts]

[ zapping]Oh... oh... ow!

Whawhawha...

Jellyspotters allow jellyfish
to eat jelly off their face.

Who wants to lick my cheeks?

I see I have some takers.

How does it feel?

[ laughs]

It tickles my nose!

Not for long...

[ all laughing]

Ah.. ah...
ahchoo!

[ zapping]

[ sizzling]

Whawhawha...

Will you cut that out?!

Am I in
The Jellyspotters now?

No! I have many more
tests for you to take.

Am I in The Jellyspotters now?

[ zapping]

No!

Am I in
The Jellyspotters now?

[ zapping]

No!

Now?
[ zapping]

No!

Now?
[ zapping]

No!

Now?
[ zapping]

No!

Now?
[ zapping]

Now?
[ zapping]

Now?

[ zapping]

Okay, SquarePants.

It is your turn to get zapped!

I mean... are you ready
for your final test?

I'm ready!

You'd better be...

because we're going to capture
a queen jellyfish!

A queen!

Can I help?

Oh, don't worry.

We can't do it without you!

This is fantastic!

I've never been bait before.

I don't think I've ever seen
a queen jellyfish either.

Well, then you've
probably never used

a queen jellyfish call.

Why don't you try it out?

[ honking]: 
Loser... loser...

Hey, I've heard
this call before.

I'll bet you have.

Hey, where you going?

Oh, don't worry.

We'll be right
behind this bush.

[ zapping]Ouch... ow!

Who's got my sting ointment?

This is great!

When I pass this test

I'll be an official
jellyfish spotter.

Loser...

Loser... loser.

Loser...

Loser...

[ weakly]: 
Loser... loser...

Loser...

Hey, Kevin...

I don't think it's working.

Nothing...

Hey... hey, Kevin, she's here!

Look! Look, she's here!

She's here, Kevin,
she's...

[ wind blows]

[ gasps]

[ screams]

[ zapping]

[ panting...]

[ panting and zapping...]

[ panting]

Aah!

Please don't be angry,
your highness.

I would have let you go!

[ crying]

[ all laughing]

[ gasps]

Kevin!

That's right!

You should have seen
the look on your face

when we zapped you!

But... what about my final test?

[ all laughing]

Did you think we'd actually
let youjoin The Jellyspotters?

But, Kevin...

I was your biggest fan.

So were they.

Hey, look, everybody!

Kevin's back!

ALL:
Kevin! We love you, Kevin!

Kevin,please!

You looked so dumb

with your dorky
jellyfish call.

Loser!

Loser, loser, loser!

Loser!

I am not a loser!

Lo... ser...

Loser! Loser!

Loser... loser...!

[ all laughing]

Huh?

[ "Rule, Britannia" plays]

Nideria rex.

King Jellyfish...

[ growls romantically]

Kissyface!

[ growls]

[ panting]

[ yelling]

[ kissing]

[ panting]

Huh?

[ chattering]

Kevin...

[ zapping]

[ yelling]

[ whistle blows]

[ grunting]

[ gasps]

I think he's gone.

One of you
go out and check.

Meepmeep. Meepmeep!

[ zaps]

Meepmeep, meepmeep,
meepmeep!

ALL:
Meep... save us... meep...

Kevin... meep... save us...

[ crying]:
Don't look at me.

I was just in this
for the fashion!

[ crying]:
It's hopeless!

We're trapped!

We're trapped...

Help me, Mommy, help me!

I want my blanky.

I want my blanky!

Now what do we do?

ALL:
Mommy... help, Mommy... Mommy...

[ growling and buzzing]

What the...?

Huh?!

Mmmmmm...

Yummy.

[ meeping and cheering]

I can't believe it.

How did you know?

[ laughs]

Everybody loves pie!

Whawhawha...

Well, SquarePants,
that was impressive

but you're still not
in the club

because you didn't catch
a queen jellyfish.

Wait! What are
you doing?

[ rip]Aah!

Wow... I didn't know
this was a hat.

It wasn't...

SPONGEBOB:
Hi, Patrick.

PATRICK:
Hi, SpongeBob.

Did you get
into that club?

Yeah, but I
turned them down.

It's not about Kevin.

It's about jellyfish.

SpongeBob, I'm glad
you learned your lesson.

Hero worship is unhealthy.

Come on, Jeffrey.

ANNOUNCER: 
The new adventures 
of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy!

We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, 
boldest...oldest superheroes

as they bravely prepare 
for vacation.

But wait!

While our heroes relax 
at Leisure Village

who will watch the Mermalair?

ManSponge!

And BoyPatrick!

BOTH:
Reporting for duty!

Yeah, yeah,
follow me.

Up, up and away!

Evil!

Now, we want you boys

to keep an eye
on the place.

Water the plants
and make sure...

Oh, my gosh,
Patrick!

SPONGEBOB:
This is the greatest wall

of superhero
secret gadgetry ever!

I get the Cosmic Ray!

I get the Aquaglove!

Hold on there, boys!

You cannot play
with this stuff.

What about the Orb of Confusion?

[ stammering]

No, no!

Prolonged exposure to
the Orb of Confusion

will give you...
confusion!

What about the
Invisible Boatmobile?

Especially not the
Invisible Boatmobile!

When we say,
"Don't touch anything"

we mean, "Don't touch anything!"

Do you understand?

Loud and clear,
trusted boy companion!

Ah, great.

Here are
the keys.

BARNACLEBOY:
We'll see you in a week.

MERMAIDMAN:
Up, up and away!

Come, BoyPatrick.

While our heroes are away,
we will keep evil at bay!

[ karatelike yelling]

Mamamamama...

What is it,

Mamamama,

Mamamama,

BOTH:
Mamamama,

Mamamama,
mamamamama!

BOTH:
Man Ray!

[ screaming]

Hey, SpongeBob, how come
he's not chasing us?

SPONGEBOB:
Looks like he's frozen.

Frfrfr, frofrofro...

It appears to be some
sort of prison chamber...

made out of frozen tartar sauce.

This is incredible!

Next to the Dirty Bubble

the evil Man Ray is the alltime
greatest archnemesis

of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy!

I have so many questions
to ask him.

[ thudding, whirring]

[ chuckling]

We're not supposed
to touch anything!

But you said
you had a question.

SPONGEBOB:
We could get
in trouble!

He said not
to touch anything!

And that includes unfreezing
a supervillain!

MAN RAY:
I'm free!

[ laughing maniacally]

Uh, actually,
Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir

only your head is free.

By the supreme authority
of wickedness

I, the evil Man Ray,
command you to release me

from this frozen prison at once!

Well, uh,
Mr. evil Man Ray, sir,
we can't do that.

Why... not?!

Because you're evil!

You mean, if I was good,
then you'd let me go?

Yeah, sure, why not?

Then, uh... in that case,
I am good.

Really?

Yes, really.

Really, really?

Yes, yes, really, really.

Really, really, really?

Yes, yes, already,
I'm good, I'm good!

Not let me out of here

or you'll suffer
dire consequences!

Well, that's
good enough for me.

[ whirring]

You fools!

Prepare to be eradicated!

Ah, ooh...

[ laughing]

What's wrong
with me?

[ laughing]:
What is this infernal
contraption?

SPONGEBOB:
Don't play dumb,
Man Ray

you know that's
the Tickle Belt

Mermaidman used on you
in episode number 17!

ANNOUNCER: 
As seen in episode 17!

Oh, I love that episode.

Oh, me, too,
me, too.

[ laughing]:
I'll never get out of here
wearing this belt!

[ laughing]

I need an evil plan that will
trick them to take it off me.

[ laughing]

Time for those acting lessons
to pay off.

[ laughing]:
Remember that part
when Mermaidman...

[ sobbing]

Oh, sob, oh, cry!

Oh, woe is me!

You don't know what it's like
being evil for so long.

Oh, how I wish to be... good.

If only some kind heroes would
show me the path to decency.

[ both gasping]

We could teach you
how to be good

and then we'll
let you go!

Ah, that would be
fantastic!

[ softly]:
I'll fake my way
through this

just like I did
in high school.

[ laughing maniacally]

Okay, Man Ray,
are you ready

for your first day
at goodness school?

Pat, get your wallet out.

Okay, goodness lesson
number one:

You see someone drop
their wallet.

[ whispering]:
Patrick, drop the wallet.

Now, what would you do?

Excuse me, sir

but I do believe you've
dropped your wallet.

Doesn't look familiar
to me.

What?

I just saw you drop ithere.

Nope, it's not mine.

It isyours.

I... I'm trying to be
a good person

and return it to you.

Return what to who?

Aren't you... Patrick Star?

Yup.

And this is your I.D.?

Yup.I found this I.D.

in this wallet

and if that's the case,
this must be your wallet.

That makes sense to me.

Then take it.

It's not my wallet.

Oh, you dim bulb!

Take back your wallet
or I'll rip your arms off!

SPONGEBOB:
Uhuh, wrong...

Good people don't rip

other people's arms off.

[ laughing]:
Oh, oh, stop!

Okay, goodness lesson
number two.

You see someone struggling
with a heavy package.

What do you do?

Hello, friend.

I noticed you were struggling
with that package.

Would you like
some help?

Ow!

Oops.

Sorry, can I
start over?

I noticed you were...

Ow!

Oops, got to
start again.

[ yelling]Oops.

You butterfingered
pink thing!

What's in that box,
anyhow?

My wallets.

[ yelling]

Oh, SpongeBob,
tickle him!

[ laughing][ groaning]

[ laughing]:
Ah, that tickles,
but it's worth it!

All right, goodness lesson
number three.

Uh... let's see...

I've got one.

I'm thinking of a number
between one and 100.

What is it?

Um... 62?

Wrong!

[ laughing]

Stop, stop...

Hey, Patrick

that's not about
being good.

Let go of it, SpongeBob!

Pat, we can use it
only when he's bad.

Let go!No, you let go!

[ straining]

[ laughing]:
Frequency rising...

belt out of control...

[ laughing]

[ laughing]:
Tickling my DNA...

[ laughing]:
Make it stop!

[ laughing]:
Please!

Did you hear that,
Patrick?

He said the "p" word.

Peanuts?

No, "please."

Well, that's good enough
for me.

I guess he's
reconstituted.

Rehabilitated.

Gesundheit.

It's graduation day, Man Ray!

This is the key to your future.

[ laughing]

[ laughing slows]

[ panting]

Just look at him, Patrick,
the picture of goodness.

[ chuckling evilly]

We're not supposed
to touch that.

Or that, either.

[ laughing]

We are really
not supposed
to touch those, sir.

[ laughing]

Good people have

no use for weapons...

[ hissing, screaming]

[ laughing]

The only thing I'm good at
is being evil.

So long, suckers!

What's that smell,
SpongeBob?

That, Patrick, is
the smell of defeat.

Good, I thought it was
my skin.

Forget about your skin,
Patrick!

Man Ray is still bad and
someone has to stop him.

This is a job
for Mermaidman...

And Barnacleboy!

To the Invisible
Boatmobile!

Ignition... on!

WaitI don't have
a license!

Well, this is
an invisible boat, right?

So you need an
invisible license!

You're the
best sidekick ever,
Barnacleboy.

[ screeching, screaming]

[ crash]

Thank goodness
for invisible seat belts!

Out of my way, fools.

You no longer
have control of me

and now this town
belongs to Man Ray!

Not so fast,
arch villain.

We still have
the Orb of Confusion.

Take this!

[ stammering]

Well, that was easy.

[ laughing maniacally]

All right, people!

Everybody stand
right where you are.

[ gasping]

I want you to, uh...

[ laughing]

[ all laughing]

No, no, stop giggling,
or I'll have to...

[ laughing]

Stop laughing, you fools!

What can I do
for you, sir?

I'll tell you
what you can do!

Give me all of your, uh...

[ laughing]:
Give me, give me all of your...

Give me...

[ laughing]

Ah! The belt is gone,
but I still feel its tickle.

The urge to do bad is gone!

[ sighing]:
I guess I'll just open
a checking account.

[ stammering]

[ gasps]

Man Ray!

No need to be alarmed,
SpongeBob.

Your teachings have
transformed me.

Besides... I have checks
with little poodles on them!

I won't be
needing this
anymore.

Farewell, fellow dogooder.

Bye, Man Ray!

Wow, we did it

just like the real
Mermaidman and Barnacleboy!

We saved the day!

Isn't it incredible, Patrick?

Patrick?

[ stammering]

Patrick, you know

that thing's
turned off, right?

Patrick, yoohoo,
Patrick?

[ applause and cheering]

KRABS:
Okay, everybody settle down.

Welcome to the Komedy Krab!

[ yukking]

Now, please give a warm welcome
to our first comic

the indiscernible
Doogie Williams.

Good evening, folks.

I'm going to skip the jokes

and get right to the part
where I throw pies at you.

[ pies smashing]

[ laughs]

I hope I do as good as that guy.

Man, those people
will laugh at anything.

Hey, don't
sweat it, kid.

I got 'em all
warmed up for you.

KRABS:
Put your fins together
for SpongeBob SquarePants!

SANDY:
Go get 'em,
SpongeBob!

Whoohoo!

Hey, hey, hey,
ladies and jellyfish

have you ever noticed
salt shakers?

I mean, you fill them up
every night at closing

and, I mean,
where does it all go?

Huh? You know what I mean?

[ cricket chirping]

[ chirping]

And tomatoeswhat's the deal
on those things?

[ chuckles weakly]

SPONGEBOB:
Because, I mean

you chop them up
into slices, but...

What are they, vegetables or...

fruit?

And what does that make ketchup?

FISH:
Oh, brother!

This guy stinks!

Hey! Hey, funny guy!

I got a joke
for you!

What smells rotten

and puts people
to sleep?

Um, noxious gas?

No! Your act!

[ laughing uproariously]

Did you ever notice
how, uh, forks, uh...

FISH:
Forks?!
Come on!

[ booing]

[ thinking]: 
Quick, SpongeBob!

Make a witty observation!

[ booing]

P.U.

[ crowd booing]

Did you ever notice
how big squirrels' teeth are?

[ chuckling]

That's true.

Huh?

I mean, hey

you could land a plane
on those things.

[ laughing]

And what's up
with that squirrel fur?

I guess fleas need a home, too.

Squirrel fur!

And they smell!

Uh, but hey, you'd stink, too

if you spent three months
buried in dirt.

[ audience laughing]

[ laughing]

Why does it take
more than one squirrel

to change a light bulb?

FISH:
Why?!

Because they're so darn stupid!

[ guffawing]

Oh, that's
a good one,
eh, Sandy?

Uh, yyeah.

That was
fantastic, boy!

You really
knocked them out!

I think I'll do this
joke night again

with youas
the headliner!

I never thought I could be
a headliner!

Whatever that is.

The headliner's
the one

who cleans up
after the show.

Well, at least I don't have
to clean up my act!

Stick with
the squirrel jokes, boy.

Now get busy!

Mops, mops, mops.

What's up with those things?

I mean, really!

Oh, hey, Sandy.

Howdy, SpongeBob.

Did you like
the show?

Well, aactually, SpongeBob, no.

Those jokes are hurtful
and you know it.

Come on, Sandy.

I was just joking.

I mean,
everybody knows

you're the smartest one
at Bikini Bottom.

Well, I can't argue with that.

We all gotta laugh
at ourselves once in a while.

I do it all the time!

[ chuckles]

You're right,
SpongeBob.

I was being
a little too sensitive.

No hard feelings.

Okay, deodorant.

Huh, let's see.

Rollon or stick?

I think she
should buy both.

[ laughs]

Huh?

FISH:
Hey, look,
guys!

It's the
stupid squirrel!

I know

let's try
and communicate
with it.

ALL:
Duh...

Hmph!

Hello,
little critter.

What's your name?

Don't stand too close
to a squirrel, Billy.

You'll catch
its stupid.

Okay, Mom.

Stupidity isn't a virus

but it sure is spreading
like one.

CROWD [ chanting]:

Because they're stupid.

Because they're stupid.

Hey, uh,
SpongeBob?

Oh, hi, Sandy.

Um, I need
to talk to you

about them
squirrel jokes.

We already talked
about that, remember?

[ laughing]

SpongeBob,
this is serious.

Since you've been
telling them jokes

people have been treating me
different.

SpongeBob,
five minutes.

[ slowly]:
Hello, Sandy.

Me Patrick.

Do you
understand?

Squirrels.

Yyyou see?!

That's what I'm
talking about.

That's just
Patrick.

He's fooling
around.

I'm just asking you
as a friend

please lay off them
squirrel jokes, okay?

Tell some of them
other jokes you got.

[ nervously]:
Other jokes?

Bah!

I got a million
of them.

Thanks, SpongeBob.

I knew
you'd understand.

[ chanting]:
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

KRABS:
Put your fins together
for SpongeBob SquarePants!

[ cheering]

Uh, hi.

[ chuckles nervously]

Uh, did you hear about
the goldfish who went bankrupt?

Now he's a bronze fish.

[ rimshot]

What?What did
he say?

I guess you heard that one.

SANDY:
I haven't
heard it!

Good one,
SpongeBob.

Thank you, you're too kind.

Hey, what about this water?

I mean, the stuff's everywhere.

Tell the one about
the squirrel and
the light bulbs!

Uh... hey, what about
this thing?

Huh? Huh?

Get on with
the squirrel jokes!

CROWD [ chanting]:
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!

Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!
Squirrel jokes!

What do I do? What do I do?

SpongeBob, you've got 
a choice to make:

Your friends or your career?

CROWD:
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!

[ all gasp]

Howdy, y'all!

[ in Southern accent]:
How come it takes
more than one squirrel

to screw in a light bulb?

ALL:
Because they're so darn stupid!

[ laughs]

My people!

Seriously, folks,
I want to give

a special thanks
to my friend Sandy.

Sandy, don't you see?

The crowd loves these jokes.

Am I right?

Don't you see, Sandy?

We're laughing with
you, not at you.

Do you understand
now, Sandy?

Huh? Do you?

I understand exactly
what's going on, SpongeBob.

Great.

I knew sooner or later
you'd get it.

What a great sport.

Let's give a big hand
to Sandy!

But clap slow, because remember,
she's a squirrel!

[ crowd cheers]

Thank you.

You've been a wonderful audience
and, uh, good night.

Ah... another spectacular
performance, SpongeBob.

Oh, what's this, a fan letter?

You did it, SpongeBob.

You get to keep your career
and your friends.

I'm glad that Sandy can finally
see the genius of my comedy.

Good morning, Sandy.

[ in Southern accent]:
Well, howdee!

Sandy, are you
feeling all right?

I'm just being
my aunaturally squirrely self.

Well, come
on in.

Y'all must be tired

from telling them
funny jokes all the time.

Why don't you take
a load off?

Uh, Sandy, I think something's
wrong with this seat.

Naw, I just done put glue on it
so you wouldn't fall off.

[ gasps]

Are them flowers
for me?

You even done
got me a vase.

But Sandy, that...
that's not a...

[ guffaws]

Ain't that purdy?

Sandy, I need wa...

Oh, that's right.

You's a sea critter.

Now, what was that thing
sea critters need?

Um... uh, let's see...
sea critters need, uh...

Wa...

Oh, wait!
Don't tell me.

I know this one.

Wa...

Wa...llet?
Watch? Waffles?

[ hoarsely]:
Sandy!

Water!

Well, why didn't you
just say so?

Here you go.

Yup, us squirrels

[ gurgling]:
Sandy!

Squirrels is dumb.

[ gurgling]:
Sandy!

Okay, Sandy, I get it!

What's that?

You want more?

Okeydokey.

More water for the sea critter.

[ gurgling]:
Okay, Sandy, okay!

I get it!

No more squirrel jokes.

CROWD [ chanting]:
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

Thank you, thank you very much.

On my way over here
I ran into a squirrel

and I said, "Hey

"why don't you go get
a couple squirrel friends

and we'll go change
a light bulb?"

[ cheering wildly]

But seriously, folks, the only
thing dumber than a squirrel

is a sponge!

I mean, we're so dumb,
we don't even have a vertebrae!

[ laughs]

Look at me!

I got no bones.

[ chuckling]

That's true.

SPONGEBOB:
Crabs? Oh, brother.

They're so cheap they can't even
pay attention!

It's true!
I am cheap!

Now let me tell you
about those fish.

Boy, are they smelly.

Whoohoo!

How could a creature

who spends so much time
in the water smell so bad?

I mean, really.

[ flatly]:
Soap, soap, what is soap?

[ crowd continues cheering 
and laughing]

SPONGEBOB:
And don't even get me started
on starfish!

SANDY:
You know, SpongeBob...

sometimes it's nice
to hang up my hang glider

and just watch the clouds
roll by.

Yep. And just relax.

Yeah...

relax.

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
You know what that
cloud looks like?

What?

A flower.

They all look like flowers,
SpongeBob... all the time.

They sure do.

You know, normally
I'd offer to race you

to the top
of Coral Cliffs

but I don't
want to miss out

on a second of this
beautiful beauty.

Me either.

Who wants to get
all dirty anyway?

Yeah... and sweaty.

Besides, I think we know
who'd get to the top first.

Yeah.

[ both laugh]

BOTH:
Me.

That's funny, Sandy.

It sounded
like you said

you could beat me
in a climbing contest.

'Course I can!

I'm a squirrel!

See!

I thought that meant
you were nuts.

Nope. It means I'm
a natural born climber!

I'm from the surface world

and nothing prepares you
for climbing

like growing up
on good old dry land.

[ laughs]

Landshmand!

It's all about
finger strength, baby.

And if there's anything
we've got plenty of down here

it's finger strength.

[ grunting]

What do you say to that,
Miss Mittens?

I say I'm already
halfway there!

Aah!

[ panting]

[ grunting]

No fair, Sandy!

You got a head start!

Sorry, SpongeBob!

That's the way
the coral crumbles!

Hey!

Ohh!

You did that on purpose!

Yeah, but this is a accident.

Aah!

Too bad you forgot
your umbrella.

I didn't...!

[ laughing]

Well, it's about time
you showed up.

But you were...
I saw you... I...

I want a rematch!

First one to the Krusty Krab
is the winner.

Ain't no way
a sea critter

can run faster
than a land critter!

I can underwater.

I'm...

hydrodynamically designed!

Think you can win
a fair race

in that clunky
tin tube?

Why don't you ask
my behind?

That is...
if you can catch it.

What do you say to that,
Hydropants?

I say, I'm already
halfway there...

halfway there...

halfway there...
halfway there...

Hey!

[ laughing]

Thanks for the face lift!

[ laughing]

You see, I told you
you didn't have a...

There you are!

Ain't that just
like a land creature

to keep a sea creature...

...waiting!

[ laughing]

I thought y'all
wanted a rematch!

I did! And I took
a head start like you did!

I was just funnin'
with ya that time!

But I guess all y'all underwater
don't have to play fair!

I guess we don't,
air breather!

Water sucker!

Tree climber!

Gulf streamer.

Kite flier!

Chum chewer!

[ gasps]

Take that back, you...
not... wet... person.

Aha! You can't
even come up
with another name!

That proves it!

Proves what?

That land critters are
better than sea critters.

Better at what?

Oh, durn near everything,
I guess.

Cattle ropin and pie eatin'
and wood choppin'

and flyin'.

What's she
blabbering about?

She says land creatures
are best.

Only 'cause
it's true.

We're best at horseridin'
and fur stylin' and rowin'.

Y'all got us licked in swimmin'

but we got corn shuckin'

and hay bailin'
and barn raisin'

and... fishin'!

[ all gasp]

And name callin'
fer sure.

And drowning!
Don't forget drowning!

[ laughs]

Good one, Squidward!
Whoo!

Not on your life,
sport.

I'll admit.

You've got some pretty
good moves, for a squirrel.

[ all laughing...]

[ laughter stops]

But you're still
just a land creature.

Squirrels can do
anything they want to!

I bet you can't eat a Krabby
Double Deluxe in one bite.

[ gulps]

Ah...

Give me that!

They don't call me Cheeks
for nothin'.

[ all laugh]

Well, that's just one thing.

Can you do this?

Everyone in my family
can do that!

Uh... uh...

How about this, huh?

Can you reproduce by budding?

Can ya?

Can ya?

Can ya?

Can ya?

No!

Most importantly

can you do this?

[ gasping]

Well, what would I want to do

any of that dumb stuff
for anyway?

Admit it, Sandy

you can't do anything
us sea creatures can do!

In fact, if it wasn't
for that suit

you couldn't even
live down here!

[ laughing]

Well, you don't...

[ laughing]

I don't need to...

[ laughing]

Grr...

I'll show y'all!

I don't need this suit!

Yah!

[ all gasp]

And I don't need
this helmet neither!

Neptune preserve her!

How long can she
stay like that?

I don't know.

Sandy's a girl?

Wow, Sandy.

You sure proved us wrong.

I guess land creatures
are better.

At least, until they need
to breathe...

[ all chuckle]

Yep, won't be long now.

[ groans]

Feeling lightheaded yet?

[ groans]:
Uhuh.

Remember this?

[ breathing deeply]

KRABS:
It's free!

[ breathing deeply]

[ groaning...]

[ gasps, gurgles]

[ gasping]

[ others laughing]

Stop laughin' at me!

I knew it!

There was no way
some "airhead"

was going to win anything
against a water breather!

Airhead...

[ laughs]

Huh?

ALL:
Sea creatures rule...!

Water! Water! Water!

All right,
all right.

You had your
little laugh.

But now
it's my turn!

Y'all think you're
such hot stuff, don't ya?

Swimmin' around with
your fancy gills 'n such!

But none of you wet heads
would last a minute on my turf.

Dry land!

Do we have to wear
pickle jars?

[ all laugh]

Nope, nothin' but the clothes
on your backs!

One minute?
No problem... landy!

[ all laugh]

[ continue laughing]

[ continue laughing]

Well, so are you going or not?

ALL:
Uh... well... we... uh...

Actually... uh...
you know... uh...

We can't... uh...
because...

We're... late
for... um...

Our fitting!

Oh, you mean
for your chicken costumes?

[ gulps]

Hey... we are not chicken!

[ gasps] My popcorn!

Yeah, we're not chicken,
we'll do it.

There! Mission accomplished!

Look, unless you can stay above
water for one measly minute

you forfeit the contest

and prove that land creatures
are better than sea creatures!

No way, Sanday.

We can take on
your challenge.

OTHERS:
Yeah!

We're not afraid of
your dumb old land.

OTHERS:
Yeah!

We're sea creatures!

ALL:
Yeah!

Okay.

Well, this is it.

Wait, boy!

Make it last.

[ gulping]

Thanks, Mr. Krabs.

Okay...

[ gulps]

Here I go!

[ gasping]

[ breathing more easily]

Hey... this isn't so bad!

We can do this!

Hey, Patrick, come on up!

The air is fine!

I'm gonna do it quick
and get it over with.

Cannonball...!

Hey, I lost my trunks!

Hi, SpongeBob!

All right, Pat!
You made it!

Mr. Krabs!

Come on up,
Mr. Krabs!

All ashore that's goin' ashore,
Mr. Squidward!

Land... ho!

Lookin' good,
Mr. Krabs!

Yeah, whoohoo!

Come on,
Squidward!

You're missing
all the dry.

Come on,
Squidward!

ALL:
Squidward! Squidward!

Well, I'll do it...
but I won't like it.

Squidward! Squidward! Squid...

What?

Well, here we are!

SQUIDWARD:
This is pretty easy!

PATRICK:
I may keep a second rock
up here!

KRABS:
Once you get your land legs,
it's not so bad!

We're the masters

of land and sea!

Hey, it's a local. Hi!

We're from underwater!

Do you know Sandy Cheeks?

Three, two, one...

Well, tan my fur!

They made it!

Better go congratulate them!

SpongeBob?

Patrick?

Hmm, where did those
critters get to?

[ all screaming]

Holy Guacamole!

You can't eat my friends,
you rats with wings!

Hiyah!

[ grunting and karateyelling]

[ splash]

Uh, thanks for
saving us, Sandy.

You know everyone's
best at something.

But no one's best
at everything.

Sorry I made you take off
your helmet, Sandy.

Sorry I made you go up
on dry land, SpongeBob.

Three cheers for feeling
sorry for ourselves!

Hooray!

NARRATOR:
Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo
is having its annual free day.

Free balloons...

free drinks...

free light bulbs?

Aha!

Top 'o the mornin', boys!

[ laughs nervously]

Whew! Next stop.. gift shop.

There it is
Oyster Stadium.

Not only do they have

the largest oyster
held in captivity

it also does tricks.

[ dramatic voice]: 
He spits a giant pearl

100 feet in the air

like a cannon ball!

Why are we hanging around
watching a cheap imitation?!

Let's get over there!

BOTH:
This is the greatest day
of our lives!

[ snoring and gurgling...]

This is the greatest
day of our lives?

Boring.

You're right, Patrick,
we came to see...

pearls 100 feet in the air!
Right?

I'll try my oyster call.

[ gibbering and trilling...]

Well, I'm outta here.

Thanks for nothin',
SpongeBob.

[ snoring and gurgling]

Come on, come on,
wake up already!

[ grunts]

[ gurgling]

I think it's working!

[ gurgling]

[ grunting anxiously]

Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!

Oh boy, did I miss it?

No, the show's
about to begin...

[ whimpering]

[ wailing loudly...]

What's wrong
with Clamu?

[ wailing...]

Easy, girl, it's me,
Joe, remember?

[ snarling]

[ screaming]

Now, this is a show!

MAN [ on p.a.]:
Attention, zoo patrons.

Clamu The Giant Oyster
is on an emotional rampage!

Please scream and
run around in circles.

[ all scream]

Thanks for coming.

[ snarling and wailing...]

You boys better get
out of this area, pronto!

There's nothing
more dangerous

than an emotionally
disturbed oyster.

You didn't do anything

that might have caused
this tragedy, did you?

Uh...

No way! Only a jerk
would upset a gentle giant.

Right, SpongeBob?

Right.

[ wailing...]

PATRICK:
Man, if I ever see
the guy who upset Clamu

I'd have a few choice words
for him, like...

"you"... and... "are"...
and... "a jerk!"

Are you sure you didn't see
anything suspicious?

I already said I didn't,
Patrick, sheesh!

Hey, lets investigate
this crime

and catch the lowlife
who's responsible.

Give it a rest, Patrick!

There's no crime
to investigate

Now go home!

Stupid Patrick...
I didn't do anything wrong!

Aw, what am I getting
so worked up about?

I'm sure that by tomorrow

this whole ugly mess
will be a funny memory
[ chuckles]

Our top story
tonight:

giant oyster has
its feelings hurt!

The only clue
that could be found

was this lone peanut!

And as you can hear,
the oyster continues

to emit its horrible cry

A cry so powerful, it can
be heard around the world

A cry that not only
breaks the sound barrier

it breaks the hearts
of our citizens!

What kind of cruel,
careless, evil person

would deliberately upset one of
Neptune's most gentle creatures?

[ meows]

Aah!

No, Gary! How would I know
anything about the oyster?

[ meows]

Defensive? I'm not
being defensive!

Barnacles! What is this,
20 questions or something?

[ Clamu wailing...]

This is getting
a little out of hand.

All I did was throw a peanut.

I didn't mean
to make the oyster cry!

I just wanted to see it
perform spectacular stunts!

Aw, everyone's going to hate me!

I, I need some advice.

Now, let's see now...

who could never hate me
no matter what I do?

Squidward!

Squidward! Oh Squidward!

SpongeBob! Do you have
to knock so loudly?

Sorry, neighbor!

Oh... that
overgrown clam

is giving me
a headache!

I can't even take
my afternoon
beauty nap!

[ laughs nervously]

Funny thing you should
mention that old oyster

Because I... uh...
was kind wondering, um...

Let's say I know this guy

who may have something
to do with the oyster.

You know the guy who did it?!

[ gulps]

Oh, this is great!

You and I can go
turn him in!

And then I'll get so much sleep,
I'll be gorgeous!

Um, actually, I...
I'm just talking hypothetically.

You don't
know who did it?

Well, um, I, uh, no!

Squidward?

Gotcha!

Aah!

Where were you
on the day of today?

Don't play games
with me, mister!

Hey, Patrick,
what are you doing?

Oh hi, SpongeBob!

I'm just continuing
my investigation

of the great Clamu Caper!

Um... have you found out
anything?

Yes!

No, wait... um... no.

But this grain of sand
looks pretty suspicious

and so does this rock!

And I've got a few questions
for this little piece of grass!

Don't worry, SpongeBob,
Patrick's on the case!

The truth will be
revealed!

I'd better go see Sandy,
she'll know what to do!

[ Clamu wailing...]Ohh, I can't stand it anymore!

That poor,
poor critter!

What kind of
inconsiderate person

would upset
such a gentle creature?

Uh, that's kind of what I
wanted to talk to you about...

Why, when I find out who caused
that oyster so much pain

No more jiggery pokery!

[ grunting]

Now, what was it you wanted
to talk about, SpongeBob?

[ gibbering]

Hey, SpongeBob, how come
you're all twitchy like that?

Twitchy? Twitchy?
Who's twitchy?

I'm not twitchy!

Sorry, Sandy,
I have to um, um...

go get my hair cut.

SpongeBob doesn't have hair...

or does he?

[ panting and whimpering]

Hey, SpongeBob!

This is it!

All of the clues
are coming together!

I followed these footprints
right to this exact spot

and then, right
where you're standing...

I found this bag
of peanuts! Ha!

Oh, I'm so close
to solving this crime

I can almost taste it!

Mmm...

Boy, crimefighting
sure makes me hungry

and this
yellow popsicle
hits the spot!

Okay, uh, good luck
with all that, Patrick

and, uh...
I'll see you later!

[ chattering and whimpering]

MAN:
Open up!
This is the police!

Uh, uh, just a second!

Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?

Yyyes?

Put those eyeballs
back in your head, son.

We've got a few
questions for you.

Were you at the zoo

on the day of the
oyster incident?

Um, um, um, yes!

Did you, or did you not
take part

in various activities
of zootime merriment?

Yes...

And are you familiar with...
this peanut?

Yes!

Just one more question...

Is it true that you were
at the oyster's lair

with a Mr. Patrick Star?

[ crying]:
Yes! Yes! It's true!

It's all true!

The merriment,
the peanut...

the Patrick!

That's all we need to know, son!

Let's book him!

Wow, you guys are good!

I'm the last person
I would have suspected

but I was looking for me
all the time!

It's the perfect crime!

Yeah, yeah, tell it
to the judge, pinky!

Oh no! Patrick's too sensitive
for the big house!

[ siren wailing]

Wait, stop!

I'm the one you want!

I am the criminal!

[ crowd yelling and booing...]

Hey, everybody, let's
throw peanuts at him

and see how he likes it!

[ crowd yelling]

I get what I deserve!

[ gulping]

Ouch!

[ crowd booing]

Wait!

Hold your peanuts!

Patrick Star is innocent!

I have come here
to reveal the truth!

They say
that truth and honesty

will be rewarded
with trust and forgiveness!

[ humming 
dramatic theme...]

I'm here to lay my cards
on the table

to trim the branches
of deception from
the tree of life

to shave away the unkempt
sideburns from the face
of truth! I...

Hey! Just get on
with it!

I am the one
who threw the peanut.

I know now that what
I have done is wrong...

and so I say, I am sorry,
giant performing oyster!

I am sorry, Patrick.

I am sorry,
citizens of Bikini Bottom

[ Patrick stops humming]

Hey! Let's
throw peanuts
at both of 'em!

[ crowd yelling]

Wait! Here's the real criminal.

Uh... top of the morning?

Mr. Krabs!

[ crowd gasps]

I knew it!

Mr. Krabs stole
a very important item

from the oyster!

Behold...

[ crowd groans in disgust]

Wait a minute...

Behold!

The oyster's pearl!

[ crowd gasps]

Here you go, girl.

[ sniffing]

[ crowd cheering]

[ crowd gasps]

[ gurgling]:
Mama! Mama!

Mother of pearl!

The oyster's a mother!

And that pearl's no pearl.

It's an egg!

[ gurgling]:
Mama! Mama!

[ gurgling]

[ both gurgling happily]

ALL:
Aw...

But it's... free day!

Ahoy, fellow fanatics!

That's a giant anchor
now, go away!

Hey,
SpongeBob.

The sky had a baby.

I know.

What should we name it?

How about...

Why don't you two
go climb its anchor rope?

I'm sure it goes somewhere
far away.

[ creaking and clanging]

Now look what you've done.

We didn't do it.

Our hands are clean.

PATRICK:
Clean.

Well, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this thing.

SPONGEBOB:
Isn't that the top?

SPONGEBOB:
Squid, wait! Squid!

Ship!

You are in your
little fantasy world.

SPONGEBOB:
No, looka giant ship.

Great, let's go.

I can give this
anchordropper a
piece of my mind.

I don't know, Squidward.

That ship has a spooky
green glow around it.

Probably because
its owner is too
lazy to clean

or drop his anchors
in the right place.

Squid, wait.

All right, who owns this crate?

Come on out, I want
to file a complaint.

[ wind howling]

Doesn't this place
seem familiar?

I don't knowwhy?

Doesn't it just ring a bell?

[ doorbell ringing]

Yes.

I know who owns
this boat.

I just can't place
the name.

[ Squidward knocking 
on door]

[ growling]

No, no, it's not...

[ repeats growling]

I am the Flying Dutchman.

That's it!

This ship belongs
to the Red Baron.

Who be disturbing
the Flying Dutchman
in his own lair?

Squidward wants
to complain to you.

[ stuttering]:
I... No, I...
I don't.

What about all that stuff
about his ship being dirty?

[ chuckling uneasily]:
I never said that.

Insulting a man's ship be worse
than insulting his mother.

Waitit washis mother
you said was dirty,
not his ship.

[ screams]

Ow.

You're next.

[ scream]

BOTH:
That was a close one.

Welcome back.

[ both scream]

That was

Welcome back.

[ scream]

Hey, how come when they act up

all they get
is the welcome wagon?

If you ask me, it's...

[ screams]

So are you going
to try that again?

Probably.

[ screams]

How about now?

No, no,
they're not.

[ sighs]

[ screams]

Now listen.

[ clears throat]

"Whosoever sets foot
on the Flying Dutchman's ship

"uninvited or otherwise

"shall become members
of his ghostly crew forever...

and, uh... ever."

Will we be getting
business cards?

Silence![ screams]

You're part
of my crew now

and our job is
to sail around and
frighten people.

It'll be grueling,
mindnumbing and repetitive.

Just like... daytime television.

Now, you listen
here, Mister.

If you think
I'm going to spend

more than five minutes
on this dumpster

then you're crazy.

I mean, look at this place.

It's disgusting.

Whoever told you
that hanging oil lamps

next to hardwood paneling
was a good idea...

I suppose you're going
to show me...

Oh, that's very nice.

Oh, is this some kind
of magic act?

[ screaming]

[ ghoulish laughter]

[ Squidward screaming]

Would anyone else
like to enter the
Fly of Despair?

No, we know
our place now,
Mr. Dutchman.

We'll do
anything you say.

Then for starters,
you can swab the deck.

[ moaning spookily]:
Look, Patrick, a real,
live ghost mop.

And I got this hat.

Listen!

We're going
to Bikini Bottom tonight

for a little haunting spree

so I want this ship
to look good and scary.

You mean you want it
to look good... and scary.

Well, I think
we could probably...

No, no, he means
he wants it to look
so good that it's scary.

Or maybe that
by looking so scary

you forget that
it doesn't look good.

I don't get it.

SPONGEBOB:
Look, it's easy...

Never mind
what it means!

I just want it
to look scary!

That's it!

You know, mold growing
on the ceilings

bugs in the sink.

So you don't want it
to look good?

Get moving!

BOTH [ rapidly]:
A sailor's life is

Since pink one's working

it's up to you to find

Here, use this spyglass.

Now, hurry up
we're burning moonlight.

Let's see who we can find.

Captain, there's a guy
we can scare.

[ heavy metal music blaring]

[ blows]

I had four biscuits,
and I ate one.

Then I only had three.

Ah... it does me heart good

to see children out
after dark.

Pink one, take us
behind those rocks.

Moving behind the rocks!

[ ship creaking]

[ grinding and crashing]

Keep going!

You're good, you're good.

You're good.

And... stop.

We'll buff out those scratches.

[ sighs]

All right,
never mind it.

Just jump out
when I give the signal.

Boo![ screams]

Prepare to be burdened
with the haunting memory

of my ghostly ghost pirates.

Was that the signal?

Okay, sorry, sorry.

Just do it again!

With the haunting memory
of my ghostly ghost pirates!

How does he do that?

[ moaning]

Get back on the ship.

BOTH [ moaning]:
It's still a mystery.

Those guys
are dorks.

Yes, but they're my dorks.

SPONGEBOB:
You're good,
you're good.

You're good.

[ thunder crashing]

[ cackling]

[ bubbling]

Huh?

[ makes gurgling sound]

SPONGEBOB:
You're good,
you're good.

You're good.

[ panting]

[ growls]

[ crash and muffled moaning]

SPONGEBOB:
You're good,
you're good.

You're good.

[ chattering]

[ cackling]

[ growling]

[ upbeat music playing]

Why did the Dutchman
ask us to wait in
our bunk room?

Maybe he's going
to give us a reward.

Like movie passes?

Or an oversized
coffee mug!

[ giggling happily]

I've been thinking.

Stop bouncing!

[ giggling stops]

This whole "crew for eternity"
thing isn't working out.

It's not really you,
so much as it is me.

You're setting us free?

Well, actually,
I'm just going to eat you.

See you at dinner.

[ both scream]

Wait.

I have an idea.

Really? What is it?

Let's leave.

But the door
is locked.

And the only way out
is through the...

perfume department!

[ elevator bells dinging 
and people talking]

Let's do it.

[ gulps]

[ breathing heavily]

[ hisses]

[ gasping]

[ hisses]

[ coughing and gasping]

Blah!

[ coughing]

[ wheezing]

[ breathing heavily]

I always hate going
in there.

Yeah.

Wait, listen!

DUTCHMAN:
Dear Diary...

I've told them
I'm going to eat them tomorrow.

I made up some
of that brown sauce

my cousin showed me
just for the occasion.

It's a good thing
I found my dining sock again.

Remember the last time
I lost me dining sock?

I couldn't eat for a whole week.

Sure, sometimes I wonder
how I survive.

If anything should
ever happen...

Ahh!

[ breathing frightfully]

Give me back my sock!

Everyone knows
I can't eat without it!

Never!

Okay, then!

Uh, oh,
give it to me!

No!

You're stretching
the elastic!

It would seem
we have reached
an impasse.

Pink one is right.

Tell you what

you give me back the sock and
I'll give you... three wishes.

Make it five.

Four.

Three.

Take it or leave it.

Okay, uh, three.

You get three wishes.

Wow! Three wishes,
Pat.

Isn't that great?!

Wishes...I wish
we had known that earlier.

[ ticks]

Okay, you got
two wishes left.

Well, we still
have two more.

How exciting!

I wish Squidward were here
to see this.

Ahh!

Boy, I'm glad all that's over.

Squidward, you're back!

Guess what.

The Dutchman gave us
three wishes!

Patrick used the first one

and I guess I...
just used the second one.

Well, then the last one
you owe me

because you got me back
into this mess!

Wait, I think
it belongs to me!

[ all shouting furiously]

That's enough!

Using my mystic
otherworldly powers

I shall decide
who gets the last wish.

Eeniemeenieminiemo,
catch a sailor by the toe.

If he hollers, let him go.

My mother told me
to pick the very best one

and you are it!

Our fate, SpongeBob!

We're about
to get eaten!

What can you wish for

to make it so
we don't get eaten?

Don't worry,
Squidward.

I've got it
all figured out.

He won't be able
to eat us

because I wish
that the Dutchman

was a vegetarian!

ALL:
Hooray!

We're home!

You did it,
SpongeBob.

We're safe!

But why have we
been turned into fruits?

Hey, I get
a wish, too.

Fruit prevents scurvy.

Ahh!

Hey, get back here
with that!

I'll get you!

[ group yelling]

Ahoy, childrenI'm back!

I hope all you boys and girls
enjoyed the show

because it's time for you
to walk the plank.

[ highpitched beeping]

Oh, sorry, kids.

What I meant to say was,
"It's time for fan mail."

[ whistling]

ALL:
Hooray!

And now the moment
you've all been waiting for!

So get ready
to blow milk out your nose

because we're going
to open a letter!

The envelope please,
Potty.

Thank you, my fine,
feathered assistant.

[ squawks]:
You're not welcome.

[ sniffing]

Hey, Potty,
you smell something?

Ah! Potty, that fuse
in your head!

I told you we're
not doing that stunt!

I didn't get the memo!

[ bang]

[ coughing]

Well, that's it
for Patchy's Pick.

Hooray!

[ chiming]

Gary, looks like it's
that time of week again.

Bath time!

Come on, let's go get
the water started.

You're going to have
to get in that tub, Gary.

Now, Gary, we can do this
the hard way or the easy way.

Or the medium way.

Or the semimedium
easyhard way.

Or the sort of hard

with a touch of awkwardeasy,
difficultchallenging way.

So that's how you want
to play it, huh?

Gary, check out
this new toy.

Fetch!

Huh?

"New Boomerang Pet Ball
Really works."

[ grunts]

Aye!

Gary, there's a bomb strapped
to my chest!

It's going to explode
in three seconds

unless you take a bath!

[ calmly]:
Please.

[ bang]

I am now going
to assault your mind

with subliminal messages.

[ giggling]

Sorry you had
to see that.

Hello, fancy
French restaurant...

I've got
a naughty snail here

who won't take a bath.

What?!

Could you say
that again?

Slow down!

It's like you're speaking
some other language.

Hey, Gar,
how about some leapfrog?

Wheehee!

Okay, your turn.

[ shell shatters]

Hey, Gar,
how about some leapfrog?

I've got a crisp
dollar bill for
the next fella

to take a bath
in this house!

[ humming]

[ breathing heavily]

That didn't
work either, huh?

Gary! Gary! Gary!

Look what I found!

It's an old pirate
treasure map
revealing the location

of buried pirate
treasure

in this very house.

Come on, boy, let's
go get that treasure!

Whoo!

Okay, Gary.

Now, 40 paces to the left.

One, two, three,
four, five, six

seven, eight,
nine, ten...

...24, 25, 26, 27... 40.

The treasure
must be in here.

Wow, Gary, look!

A pirate treasure chest!

Meow.

Why, no, Gary,
this isn't the bathtub.

It's treasure!

Lookdoubloons.

Don't drop them.

Look at this brooch!

Meow.

I don't know what a snail
wants with a brooch!

Now, why don't you
just get in the tub?!

Get in the tub!

Get in the tub!

Get in the tub!

In the tub!

In the tub!

Now, Gary, are you going
to get in this tub

or am I going
to have to...

Gary, uh... could you, uh...

Gary, no!

Gary!

[ splash]

All right, Gary.

You have duped and/or
frustrated me for the last time!

So if I can't get you
to come to the bath

I'll just have to bring the bath
to you.

[ gurgling]

SPONGEBOB:
Psst... Gary...

Bath delivery.

Come back, Gary.

I have something
to share with you.

This is more like it.

Meow.

What are you waiting for, Gary?

Meow, meow, meow.

Oh, stuck in a tree?

Meow, meow, meow.

It's time
to clean up your act, Gary.

[ inhales]

[ over record]:
Meow, meow, meow...

Oh, no!

I bathed Gary too hard
and removed his skin.

GARY [ happily]:
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

Gary!

Bring that ladder back
this instant!

I am not amused, mister.

You're going to take a bath and
you're going to get clean now!

Meow.

I am sothe boss of you.

Meow.

It's a free country

but you live in my house,
under my rules.

Meow.

Don't use that tone with me.

You will do what I say,
when I say!

What are you doing?

I am talking to you, Mister.

Do not go near that mud puddle!

Gary, do you hear me?!

I am giving you
three seconds

to get a away
from that mud puddle.

One, two,
two and a half...

Don't make me say three.

Gary!

Gary! Gary!

Gary!

I'm a dirty boy.

Meow.

Yeah, yeah, Gary, I'm
getting behind my ears.

KRABS:
Come on, SpongeBob,
it's quitting time.

I've got a card
game tonight.

Who are you playing
cards with, Mr. Krabs?

I'm going over to the Chum
Bucket to play with Plankton.

[ gasps]

Plankton!

But, Mr. Krabs,
he's your archenemy.

He's been trying to steal the
Krabby Patty formula for years.

Ouch.

Why would you
play cards with him?

Between you and me

Plankton is the
worst card player
in Bikini Bottom!

Why, I've been taking him 
to the cleaners

every Thursday night 
for 15 years!

I never lose!

[ laughs]

[ both laughing]

[ crying]

[ SpongeBob laughing]

Taking him
to the cleaners

that's a hot one!

How was the card
game, Mr. Krabs?

I lost.

Barnacles, Mr. Krabs.

How much money did you lose?

I didn't lose any money.

I lost...

Don't tell me you lost
the Krusty Krab!

I lost...

Mr. Krabs

please tell me
you didn't lose

the Krabby Patty
secret formula!

I... lost...

you!

What?

I bet your contract and I lost.

[ laughs]

Good one, Mr. Krabs.

Well, I got to make
those Krabby Patties.

[ grunting]

D'oh!

I'm afraid you
don't work here
anymore.

Please tell me
this isn't a joke.

Go on, Mr. Krabs.

Tell him.

Tell him all about
your cruel, sick joke.

As much as I love
cruel, sick jokes

I'm afraid he's not joking.

You work for me now, SpongeBob.

Time to put on the official
Chum Bucket bucket helmet.

[ screams]

But, Mr. Krabs

I don't want
to work for him!

I want to work
for you

here at
the Krusty Krab!

[ sobbing]

I'm sorry, boy!

[ both sobbing]

It's all
my fault!

[ sobbing]

What kind of cold,
heartless person

would break apart
such a loving relationship?

I would!

[ sobbing]

[ screams]

SpongeBob!

Mr. Krabs!

This is your
greatest blunder, Krabs.

For 15 years I've been throwing
those card games

just waiting for you
to slip up.

I may not have

the precious
Krabby Patty formula

but I've got the next best
thing: the guy who makes them!

I'm going
to run you

out of business,
Krabs.

Mr. Krabs!

SpongeBob!

[ sobbing]

[ sniffling]

Can I have my arms back?

Ay!

What is this place?

[ machines start up]

[ yelps]

[ buzzer]

[ screams]

Okay, I'm ready

for my Krabby Patty!

Actually, uh,
Mr. Plankton, sir

I haven't, uh...

Perhaps you don't
understand.

You work for me now

and as your
new boss

I command you
to make me a patty
this instant

or I'll be forced
to remove your brain

and implant it
in my robot chef.

So get cooking.

The sign
says "kitchen"

but my heart says "jail."

[ slow tune begins]

A stove is a stove
no matter where you go...

A patty is a patty,
that's what I say...

A grill is a grill

This is surely so...

And fries should be fries
either way...

But this grill
is not a home

This is not
the stove I know...

I would trade it all away
if you'd come back to stay...

BOTH:
This kitchen's not the same
without you

It's just
a greasy spoon...

Just a greasy spoon...

BOTH:
Without you...

[ sobbing]

What is he doing?

All these tears?

And the show tunes?

Why isn't he making the patties?

Forget it!

I'm going
with Plan B.

I'll put his brain

in the
robot chef.

COMPUTER:
You know that
never works.

The answer is obvious.

To get to the SpongeBob

you must show him compassion
and understanding.

Then he'll give you
what you want.

Will you be quiet?

I'm thinking!

I've got it!

To get to the SpongeBob

I'll show him compassion
and understanding.

Then he'll give me what I want.

Hi.

I'm sorry, Plankton!

I'm trying my best!

I'm not used
to cooking this way.

Please don't take
my brain out!

Hold it, SpongeBob.

I'm capable
of compassion

and understanding.

Really?

Then let me go back
to the Krusty Krab.

Let's not get carried away.

Now, what can I do
to make you more comfortable

here at the Chum Bucket?

Well, I usually
cook on a grill.

You got it!

[ Plankton grunting]

Well, it wasn't easy,
but here it is:

one old frying grill.

How about we try it out?

Uh, it's just that...

I'm used to the grill
facing that way.

Say no more.

I'll take care
of everything.

[ grunting]

How about here?

A little more
to the left.

[ grunting]

How's this,
SpongeBob?

Move it over
a little more.

[ grunting]

Here?

Keep going.

Here?

Almost!

That's it.

Just a little
more...

[ grunting]

Perfect!
Right there!

[ growls]

I don't know.

Something still
doesn't feel right.

PLANKTON:
Just a few more
steps, SpongeBob.

Okay, go ahead,
take it off.

It's an exact replica
of the Krusty Krab kitchen!

[ gasps]

It is an exact replica.

Here's the sink!

The greasy fryers!

The squeaky floorboards!

And that thing!

One Krabby Patty
coming up, Mr. Krabs!

[ sobbing]

Oh, Mr. Krabs...

Don't cry, SpongeBob.

I'll show you it's much better
working for me.

Is there anything
that old skinflint Krabs

wouldn't let you have?

Well, there is one thing
I've always wanted.

[ shoes chugging]

Wow!

So, now do you
have everything
you need

to make some
Krabby Patties?

Well...

Are you ready to
make some patties?

Wait till I finish
my ice cream!

How about
those patties?

[ laughing]:
Faster, faster!

Faster!

"And then the littlest
sea elf said..."

Huh?

[ snoring]

[ growls]

Steady, Plankton.

It's all going
to pay off soon enough.

Hey there,
sleepyhead.

What do you say?

All that preparation
is making me hungry.

Me, too!

You know what
would hit the spot?

Why don't you whip us up
some Krabby Patties?

Mmm, I'm kind of
in the mood for tacos.

[ chuckles weakly]

Good one, SpongeBob.

But really, go ahead
and make us some patties.

[ yawns]

Nah, I don't really
feel like it.

But I don't
understand.

You have the grill
and the spatula

and the comfy chair.

I rubbed your putrid feet!

Tell you what, halfpint,
why not ask me later?

[ growls]

I command you
to make me a patty this instant!

No!
Don't back
sass me!

[ imitates Plankton]:
Blah, blah, blah.

What?!

[ blows raspberry]

That's it, mister.

You just lost
your brain privileges.

[ electricity crackling]

Finished.

SpongeBob, come in here.

[ chuckles]

Or should I say
RobotBob

SpongeChefPants?

I put the brain
in the robot, you know.

You shouldn't have been
a spoiled brat.

You see, I always get
what I want

and I want you to make me
a Krabby Patty!

[ beeping]

Response: Why don't you
ask me later?

What?

What?!

Get welded.

Wait!

I command you

make me
a Krabby Patty!

I don't want to.

[ screaming]

Well, old girl, this looks
like our final chapter.

Huh?

[ sobbing]:
I can't take
any more.

[ sobbing]

You've got to
take that yellow
nightmare back!

It's not worth it!

I'm better off

stealing a Krabby Patty
fair and square.

Um... well,
a deal's a deal,
Plankton.

He's your headache now.

Oh, please
have mercy, Krabs!

I'll do anything.

I beg of you!

How about you
give me 50 bucks

and I'll take him
off your hands?

It's a deal!

I cheated anyway.

Now, begone with you,
you puny pest!

Thank you!

[ crash]

Ouch.

My brain and I are glad

to be back, Mr. Krabs.

Good to have
you back, lad!

Now, get
to those patties!

The lunch rush
is acoming!

[ yawns]

I don't feel
like it.

Why don't you ask
me later, Krabby?

[ laughs]

I mean, I'm working
all day for free

my treat.

That's what
I thought you said.

NARRATOR:
Well, well, what is this?

Ah, the artist at sea.

Let us watch and see
the fruits of his struggle.

Oh, it seems
as if inspiration has struck.

[ artist mumbling 
and chuckling]

The pencil, what...?

NARRATOR:
The artist has learned

the first lesson of the sea:
Always bring a spare pencil.

ARTIST:
No!

[ scream echoing]

Okay, ready, Patrick?

One...

Two...

Three!
Three!

Scissors beats
paper, Patrick.

[ both laughing]

One...

Two...

Three.

Patrick, how come
you always do paper?

[ whistling; bubbles pop]

[ screaming]

What is that
thing, SpongeBob?

It looks like
a giant pencil.

Go touch it.

It is a giant
pencil, Patrick.

Let's draw some
giant pictures with it.

What you drawing?

Stand back, Patrick,
I can't draw

with you breathing
down my neck.

[ scoffs]:
Artists.

SPONGEBOB:
It's a jellyfish.

PATRICK:
Pretty good, SpongeBob

but it's lacking
basic construction

and your
perspective

leaves a lot
to be desired.

SPONGEBOB:
Huh, everybody's a critic.

[ drawing slurping]

SpongeBob,
your drawing's
coming to life!

Ha, ha, that's more like it,
Mr. Critic.

No, I mean it's
swimming away!

Do you know what
this means, Patrick?

Your art can never
hang in a museum.

It means we found
a magic pencil!

Now all I need is
a magic moustache

and all my dreams
will have come true.

[ cackling]:
Coming right up.

Life is good!

Easy come,
easy go.

SQUIDWARD:
Squidward, if you had some hair

you'd be the most gorgeous
creature in the sea!

You've got looks, talent

all you need
is a full head of...

hair!

My turn!

Be careful, Patrick.

Being an artist is
a heavy responsibility.

Each work of art is like a child
and must be treated as such.

Come on, I was just
going to draw a cartoon!

Okay, why didn't
you say so?

Hey, another
jellyfish!

It's Squidward, silly!

[ drawing grumbling]

It's kind of
creepylooking
when it moves.

Ooh, you're right,
SpongeBob.

We can't let him
go to town!

[ grumbling]

[ screaming]

[ screaming fades]

Poor Squidward.

Hey!

My brain just
hatched an idea.

[ both giggling]

[ giggling]

This is going to be classic.

I think I fancy a stroll
around the park.

SPONGEBOB [ ringing doorbell]:
Oh, Squidward!

What do you want...

Hello, what's this?

Someone left me
some money for a perm.

[ snickering]

Come to Hairy!

Ow!

[ laughing]

SpongeBob!

Oh, my hair!

SpongeBob!

[ laughing maniacally]

Wait.

I've got
another idea.

This'll be the ultimate prank.

I'll draw me, and when
Squidward answers the door

it won't be me!

[ Patrick guffawing]

Aw, look at him.

Ain't he a doll?

All he needs is a tie.

Ready for action!

[ shouting 
nonsense words]

[ laughing]

PATRICK:
He's going to the door!

[ giggling]

[ knocking]

He's knocking on the door.

Squidward's
answering the
door, and...

Oh, ow, ow, ow!

He's beating up
Squidward!

[ Squidward shouting]

Doodle Boy, stop!

[ crashing]

[ speaking gibberish]

He's got the pencil.

What have I done?

We've got to find him.

Where could he
possibly be?

Maybe he's

in that poorly
drawn pineapple.

Come on, let's go.

I'm not going
in there.

Come on, Patrick,
I'm right behind you.

Baby steps.

SPONGEBOB:
Almost there...

[ screaming while falling]

[ crashing]

What just
happened?

[ Doodle Boy 
shouting gibberish]

[ speaking menacingly]

Come on, Patrick,
give me a boost up.

Can't we just
stay down here
where it's safe?

No way.

I created
this monster

and I've got
to stop him.

[ Doodle Boy shouting]

See what I mean,
Patrick?

Where's the leak,
ma'am?

[ screams]

[ crashing]

[ another crash]

You okay, Patrick?

PATRICK:
Finland!

[ Doodle Boy shouting]

[ Doodle Boy 
speaking gibberish]

[ Doodle Boy 
speaking gibberish]

[ whispering]:
There he is.

He's hideous.

PATRICK:
He makes me sick
just looking at him.

Those big bulgy eyes

that square body,
those two buck teeth

and that stupid tie!

[ clears throat]

Oh, but it looks good
on you, SpongeBob!

[ laughs nervously]

[ Doodle Boy babbling]

He's putting down the pencil.

This is our chance.

On the count of three

we'll jump out
and surprise him.

Oh, boy, a
surprise party!

Is it his birthday?

[ shouting]

Patrick, Patrick!

Do something!

Happy birthday!

[ SpongeBob screaming; 
loud crash]

Here's your
present.

[ clunk]

You're welcome.

[ shouting gibberish]

Hold it right
there, Doodle.

I brought you into this world

and now I'm going
to take you out.

Any last words?

[ speaking 
gibberish]

I'm... I'm sorry,
what was that?

[ repeating gibberish slowly]

[ screaming]

[ gibberish is muffled]

[ crashing]

Hold still,
Doodle.

This is for your own good!

Take that, and this, and this

and that, and this, that, this,
that, this, that...

[ speaking gibberish]

[ screaming]

I am SpongeBob,
destroyer of evil!

Take it easy

it's just
a drawing.

Well, that takes care
of that, eh, Patrick?

Done and done.

SPONGEBOB:
Gee, Gary, you should
have been there.

It sure was exciting.

But you know, I kind of miss
the little doodle.

He was like a son to me.

But I am glad that
things are back to normal.

Well, good night, sweet prince.

[ meows]

Good night, magic pencil.

[ snoring]

[ light switch clicks]

[ another switch clicks]

[ toilet flushing]

[ SpongeBob snoring]

[ scratching]

Oh, hey, magic pencil.

What are you doing up?

Drawing yourself
a glass of water?

[ cackling]

DoodleBob!

[ laughs nervously]

No hard feelings, right?

[ screams]:
What do you think
you're doing, Doodle?

You Doodle!

Me SpongeBob!

[ screaming]

[ Doodle screaming gibberish]

[ eraser squeaking]

[ thunk]

[ screaming]

[ Doodle Boy screaming]

[ eraser squeaking]

Huh?

[ screaming]

Be careful with that thing.

Who knows what
will happen?

I knows.

[ shouting gibberish]

[ laughing maniacally]

Very funny, Doodle.

Now it's
my turn.

[ both grunting]

Well, Doodle,
it looks like this...

is a draw.

[ blades whining]

You've made your point.

No matter, I was voted
"most artistic" in high school.

[ glass breaks; hollow thump]

SQUIDWARD:
Ouch! You're going
to pay for that!

Uh, maybe it was
"most clumsy."

[ screaming]

[ shouting gibberish]

Huh?

Huh?

Paper!

Page for
Mr. Doodle!

[ screaming]

[ scream fades away]

PATRICK:
Hey, SpongeBob

what's with
all the ruckus?

Take a look
for yourself, Patrick.

It's the evil doodle!

No, no, not evil.

He was just
a twodimensional creature

lost in our threedimensional
aquatic world

longing for a purpose.

So... he's a drawing?

Exactly.

See how happy he is?

He still looks
kind of creepy.

O great magic pencil

your powers are too mighty
for us ocean dwellers

so I will send you back

to the magic kingdom
from where you came.

Are you ready, Patrick?

Ready!

Always bring a pencil sharpener.

Patrick?

Patrick?

Oh, Patrick!

Are you ready to
go jelly fishing?

[ creaking]

Oh, boy, am I!

Here's your net.

Well, come on,
Patrick.

The jellyfish don't
catch themselves.

First, I have to put away
my secret box.

Secret box?

You never told me
about your...

secret box.

Hey! Hands off,
Peeping Bob.

This here's mysecret box.

Besides, if I showed you
what was inside

it wouldn't be
a secret anymore.

Duh!

[ creaking]

[ goofy laughter]

Oh, Spongebob!

If only you could see
inside my secret box

it would change
your life.

It's okay, Patrick,
I know all about secrets.

You do?

I've got
a gazillion secrets.

Like what?

Well, it's no secret that
the best thing about a secret

is secretly telling someone
your secret

thereby secretly adding
another secret

to their secret collection
of secrets... secretly.

[ electrical buzzing]

You want to hear
one of my secrets?Do I?!

Uh... let's see.

Did you know
you're my best friend?

No... way.

Oh, let's hear another one!

Okay. Uh... secretly,
I'm a little bit naive.

Wow!

I'll never look at you
the same way again, Spongebob.

Gosh!

[ clears throat]

Tell me some more secrets!

Okay...

I love my job
at The Krusty Krab.

I sleep with my shoes on.

I like jelly
on both sides of my toast.

I've got
an overdue library book.

...overbite.

I've never been late for work.

I've said the word "fancy"
in conversation.

I still don't have
my driver's license.

I'm a little
on the short side.

I'm wearing three pairs
of underwear now.

Gasp!

I never would have guessed.

Now will you show me
what's inside your secret box?

No, Spongebob!

It's for me to know,
and for you to neverfind out!

You may be an open
book, Spongebob

but I'm a bit more
complicated than that.

The inner machinations
of my mind are an enigma.

Oh, yeah?! Well, I got
plenty of secret stuff, too!

Uh...

I've got my secret socks on.

[ panting]

And my secret Gary's bowl.

[ grunting]

My secret TV

and my secret TV channel.

[ tone]

What do you think of that,
Patrick?

Patrick?

[ goofy laughter]

[ guffawing]

[ gasping for air]

Whew!

[ laughing harder]

[ laughing hysterically]

[ gasping]

Oh, whew!

Maybe if you saw
what was inside

you'd know why it
has to be secret.

Inside this very box is
the most secrety secret

in all of Secretdom,
and I am its sole witness!

It's a heavy burden,
Spongebob

but nobody must know
the mystery of the box.

Nobody!

[ knees knocking]

Not even...
Squidward's house.

It's a fulltime job.

I'm constantly on the alert.

You never know
when someone's going to...

[ gasps]

[ jabbering]

[ grunts]

Spongebob, what do you
think you're doing?!

That's my secret box!

Now hand it over!

But, Patrick,
I must know the secret.

For the last time,
Spongebob, no!

Come on, just a peek.

[ grunting]:
Never!

[ grunting]

[ pop][ gasps]

So, it's come to this.

And to think we joined
the Best Friends Forever Club!

[ tinkling]

[ grunts]

Listen up, Spongebob
"Secret Stealer" Pants!

If you evercome near
my secret box again

we won't be friends anymore!

But... we're supposed to be...
friends forever.

[ giggling]

[ laughing]

[ laughter continues]

[ muffled laughter]

[ sniffles]

I feel so filthy.

I have soiled
our friendship garden.

[ sobbing]:
I just couldn't help myself.

I know it's your secret.

I promise to respect that.

Oh, please forgive me,
Patrick, please!

Well...

[ squishy noises]

I guess it's not
all your fault.

After all, this is
a pretty great secret.

I mean, how could you resist

the greatest secret ever?!

The most amazing...

mysterious...

powerful secret in
all of Bikini Bottom?

So, what do you say, buddy?

Friends?

Friends.

SPONGEBOB: 
What could be in that box

that Patrick 
doesn't wantme to see?

Maybe it's the world's
only albino jellyfish

or maybe Patrick's
a master jewel thief

and it's full of diamonds.

Or maybe Patrick's
a deranged maniac

who keeps his victims'
severed heads in a box.

Or even worse

maybe it's
an embarrassing snapshot of me

from a Christmas party.

[ shrieking]

I got to find out
what's in that secret box.

I'm not going to
rest till I do!

That's it.

How do you look
into a secret box?

Secretly, of course.

I'll just take the box
while Patrick's sleeping

look inside

and before Patrick

even has time to notice

I'll slide it back.

Patrick won't know

and I'll have
my own little secret.

Good idea, eh, Gary?

Mmm... No.

SPONGEBOB: 
Oh, what do you know?

You're a snail.

[ snoring]

[ snorting]

Snizzlefrazzy!

[ snoring]

Who's it?!

[ snoring]

Seeecret.

I got to be more quiet.

I don't want to wake Patrick up.

[ loud, continued racket]

[ glass shattering]

[ racket continuing]

[ whizzing]

[ snoring]

Gee, Patrick sure is
a heavy sleeper.

Huh? Who said that?

Who's there?!

Uh...

It's the clam burglar!

And he's stealing my secret box!

Hand over the goods,
secretbox bandit

and prepare for
the most unpleasant

pillow fight of your life!

[ gun cocking]

Wait, wait, wait, Patrick. Stop!

It's me, Spongebob!

Nice try, burglar.

But Spongebob's my best friend
and he'd never steal from me.

No, really, Patrick.
Look.

[ gasps]

It's
the Best Friends Forever

Best Friends Forever Ring!

Our friendship ring.

It isyou!

[ sobbing]:
How could you do this?

If it makes you
feel any better

I haven't looked inside.

That's it, Spongebob.

You have crossed the line.

As of right now, this
friendship is over!

Really?

Nah, you can look inside
if you really want to.

Okay!

Oh, this is one of the most
exciting moments of my life.

Well, here it goes.

Huh?

Well? Didn't I tell you?

Isn't it great?

It's just a string.

A secret string!

Boy, when you're right,
you're right.

That's some secret box
you got there.

Yeah. Thanks
for showing me that.

Well, good night, Patrick.

See you tomorrow.

Good night, Spongebob.

I should have known.

It was just
a piece of string all along.

[ cackles]

Wait till I tell Gary.

[ laughing]

Good thing he didn't pull
the secret string

opening the secret compartment

of my secret box

revealing one embarrassing
snapshot of Spongebob

at that Christmas party.

[ Patrick laughing]

Merry Christmas, Spongebob!

[ laughter]

[ clarinet plays]

[ doorbell chimes]

Yeah, uh, we're with

the pet hospital
down the street

and I understand
you have

a dying animal
on the premises.

[ rings]

Hello.

You've reached The House
of Unrecognized Talent.

Please start after the...

[ clarinet squeals]

Sounds as though
you've got a dying animal

to attend to,
eh, old chum?

[ gasps]

Squilliam Fancyson
from band class?

I hear you're playing
the cashregister now.

Well, sometimes.

Uh, how's the unibrow?

It's big and valuable.

I'm the leader of
a big fancy band now

and we're supposed to play
the Bubble Bowl next week.

The BuBuBu... the BuBuBu...
the BuBuBu...?

That's right.

I'm living your dreams,
Squidward.

The problem is, I'm busy
next week and can't make it.

So, I was hoping you and your
band could cover for us.

Oh, uh... IIII'd, uh...

I knew it!

You don't even
have a band.

Well, I'll just
let you get back

to the service
industry now.

Hold it!

It just so happens that
I don't sell fast food

I do have a band

and we're going to play
that Bubble Bowl.

How do you like that, Fancyboy?

Good luck next Tuesday.

I hope the audience brings
lots of ibuprofen.

I've got to drum up
a marching band fast.

Drum.

[ chuckles]

Band humor.

"Looking to add fulfillment
to your dull, dull life?"

"Then become part of
the greatest musical sensation

ever to hit Bikini Bottom."

"And be forever adored

by thousands of people
you don't know."

"Not to mention
free refreshments."

"Practice begins tonight,
8:30 sharp."

Stupid music rental clerk
made me late.

That trilobite didn't know
an oboe from an elbow.

Hmm, elbow, hmm.

More band humor.

ALL:
Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

Blah, blah, blah, blah.

People, people!

Settle down.

Okay, now.

How many of you have played
musical instruments before?

Do instruments of torture count?

No.

Is mayonnaise an instrument?

No, Patrick, mayonnaise
is not an instrument.

Horseradish is not
an instrument either.

That's fine, no one
has any experience.

Fortunately, I have enough
talent for all of you.

[ laughing]

[ laughing]:
All of you.

[ laughter subsiding, coughing]

When do we get
the free food?

Okay, try to repeat after me.

[ inhales]

[ plays musical scale]

Brass section, go.

[ plays sharp notes]

Good. Now the wind.

[ plays flat notes]

And the drums.

[ sputtering]

Too bad that didn't kill me.

Let's just try stepping
in rhythm.

Now, I want everyone to stand
in straight rows of five.

Is this the part
where we start kicking?

No, Spongebob,
that's a chorus line.

Kicking?!

Oh, I want to do
some kicking!

[ grunts]

Why, you...!

Why, I ought to...!

[ yelling]

[ Patrick bellowing]

[ clamor subsides]

[ footsteps approaching]

Whoever's the owner
of the white sedan

you left your lights on.

[ horn blowing notes]

[ long note blows]

[ chaotic music playing]

Okay, that's
perfect, everybody.

Bubble Bowl, here we come.

Flag twirlers, really
spin those things.

Okay, turn.

Flag twirlers, let's go.

I want to see
some spinning.

Flag twirlers, let's move!

Come on!
Move!

[ playing "Taps"]

How's that harmonica solo
coming, Plankton?

It's tremendous.

You want to see?

[ inhales deeply]

[ note plays]

[ high note plays]

[ panting]

[ low note plays]

[ note plays]

[ note plays]

[ gasping for air]

[ panting]

[ inhaling weakly]

[ high tinny note plays]

[ groans]

Well, this is our last night
together before the show.

And I know that you haven't
improved since we began.

But I have a theory.

People talk loud when they
want to act smart, right?

[ shouting]:
Correct!

So if we play loud,
people might think we're good.

Everybody ready?

And aone and atwo

and aone, two, three, four!

[ loud blast of music]

Okay, new theory.

Maybe we should play so quietly,
no one can hear us.

Well, maybe we
wouldn't sound so bad

if some people
didn't try to play

with big, meaty claws.

What did you say, punk?

Big... meaty... claws!

Well, these claws ain't
for just attracting mates.

Bring it on, old man!

Bring it on!

No, people.

Let's be smart and bring it off.

Oh, so now the
talking cheese is
going to preach to us.

[ crowd murmuring]

Wait, wait!

I know tensions are high.

Take that!

[ yelling]

[ squabbling]

There's a deposit
on that equipment, people!

Settle down, please!

[ karate yell]

[ growls]

Hit him! Hit him!

[ yelling]

[ ding]

[ squabbling stops]

Hey, class is over.

Okay, yeah, see ya tomorrow.

That was good.

Say, what are you doing after...

[ chattering stops]

Well, you did it.

You took my one chance
at happiness

and crushed it.

Crushed it into little,
tiny, bitesize pieces.

I really had expected
better of you people.

I guess I'm a loser
for that, too.

Don't bother showing up
tomorrow.

I'll just tell them you all
died in a marching accident.

So, thanks.

[ cries]:
Thanks for nothing.

You're welcome.

What kind of
monsters are we?

That poor creature
came to us in
his hour of need

and we failed him.

Squidward's always
been there for us

when it was
convenient for him.

Evelyn, when your little
Jimmy was trapped in a fire

who rescued him?

A fireman.

And, Larry, when
your heart gave out

from all those
tanning pills,
who revived you?

Some guy
in an ambulance.

Right.

So, if we all
could just pretend

that Squidward was a fireman
or some guy in an ambulance

then I'm sure we could all
pull together

and discover what it truly means

to be in a marching band.

Yeah, for
the fireman!

ALL:
Yeah!

Now let's make Squidward proud.

Aone, atwo,
a squiddlydiddly do.

SQUIDWARD:
I knew this was going to happen.

They're just going to have
to find another band to play.

I just hope that...

Squilliam doesn't find out!

Squilliam! Aw!

What are you doing here?

[ chortling]

I just wanted
to watch you blow it.

So, where's your band?

Uh... they couldn't come.

They... died.

Then who's that?

Ah! That would
be my band!

We're ready to
perform, Squidward.

Well, Squiddy,
this is exactly

how I pictured
your band would look.

That's his eager face.

[ chortling]

I guess this will be
the last time

I can show my face
in this town.

That's the spirit,
Squidward.

ANNOUNCER:
Okay, football fans

put your hands together

for the Bikini Bottom
Super Band!

[ wild cheering]

[ whooping]

Yeah!

These are some
uglylooking fish.

Maybe we're near one of
those toxicwaste dumps.

I think I'm going to be sick.

Okay, everybody.

[ chortles]

Let's get this over with.

One, two, three...

four...

[ playing fanfare 
in perfect pitch]

[ rock ballad intro plays]

The winner takes all

It's the thrill
of one more kill

The last one to fall

Will never sacrifice
their will

Don't ever look back
on the wind closing in

The only attack
were their wings on the wind

Oh, the daydream begins

And it's sweet, sweet,
sweet victory, yeah

And it's ours for the taking

It's ours for the fight

Oh!

In the sweet, sweet,
sweet victory, yeah

And the world is ours
to follow

Sweet, sweet, sweet victory.

Ah, the Krusty Krab

Bikini Bottom's premiere
daytime eatery

where it'll be closing time
right... about...

now!

8:00.

[ kissing noise]

So long, suckers!

I've got a hot date
with a little lady

and her name is clarinet.

[ knocking]

What?

Are you open?

Read the sign.

I'll have
a Krabby patty deluxe

and a double
chili kelp fries.

No, you won't.

I can't hang out here all night.
I've got a life.

Well, fine, if you
don't want my money.

MR. KRABS:
Money?

You mean, if we
stayed open later

you'd give us
your money?

Sure.

Mr. Squidward,
welcome to the night shift.

From now on, The Krusty Krab
is open 24 hours a day.

What?

Wow!

Now we never have
to stop working.

Mr. Krabs...

See you in
the morning, boys.

I can't hang out here
all night, Igot a life.

Mr. Krabs...

Isn't this great,
Squidward?

Just you and me together for
hours and hours and hours?

And then the
sun'll come up?

And it'll be tomorrow, and
we'll still be working.

[ gasping]:
It'll be just like
a sleepover!

Only we'll be sweaty
and covered with grease!

Are you ready to rock,
Squidward?!

No.

Good, 'cause we've
got customers!

Here; please hit me
as hard as you can.

Psst. Squidward.

I'm working in the kitchen...

[ giggles]:
At night.

Don't hold back.

Hey, Squidward, guess what?

I'm chopping lettuce...
at night.

Look at me, I'm swabbing

at night.

Ow! I burned my hand!

At night.

Night, night, night

Will you, please?!

Here, give me a moment's peace
and take out the trash.

All right.

Taking out the trash.

Taking out the trash, at n...

[ brakes squeal]

[ scary music]

You mean, outside?

That's where
the dumpster is, yes.

I don't know, Squidward,
it's kind of dark out there.

But I thought you 
likedthe night shift.

You're right.

For the The Krusty Krab!

[ screaming]

[ screaming continues]

[ gasping]

[ snaps fingers]Piece of cake.

So, you're not afraid?

Pfft! Nah.

Well, I am, especially after...

[ gulp]

Well, you know.

What? What do I know?

You don't remember?
It was all over the news.

Tell me. Tell me.

No, no, I probably shouldn't.

It would ruin
the night shift for you.

What happened?
What happened? What?

You mean you've never
heard the story of the...

"HashSlinging Slasher"?

The SlashBringing Hasher?

The HashSlinging Slasher.

The SashWringing...

the TrashSinging...
MashFlinging...

The FlashSpringing...
Wringing...

thethe Crash

Dinging... uh....

Yes, the HashSlinging Slasher.

But...

Most people just
call him the Ha... [ gasps]

Because that's all
they have time to say

before he...

Gets them!

[ gasps]

Tell me the story!

Years ago,
at this very restaurant

the HashSlinging Slasher
used to be a fry cook

just... like...

you.

Only clumsier.

And then one night

when he was 
cuttingthe patties

it happened.

He forgot the
secret sauce?No.

He didn't wash
his hands?No.

Irregular
portions?No!

He cut off
his own hand by mistake.

You mean like this?

Or like this? Or this?

Or this?

But what about this?
Or this? Or this?

Or this?! Or...

Except he wasn't a sponge.

So?

So it didn't grow back!

[ screaming]

And he replaced his hand
with a rusty spatula.

And then
he got hit by a bus!

And at his funeral

they fired him!

So now, every...
what day is it?

Tuesday.

...Tuesday night, his ghost
returns to The Krusty Krab

to wreak his horrible vengeance.

[ gasps]But tonight's Tuesday night.

Then he'll be coming.

How will we know?

There are three signs
that signal the approach

of the HashSlinging Slasher.

First, the lights
will flicker on and off...

Next...

Dude, can I have
some ketchup?

Oh. Here you go.

Next...

the phone will ring, and
there will be nobody there.

And finally,
the HashSlinging Slasher

arrives in the ghost of the bus
that ran him over!

Then, he exits the bus
and crosses the street

without
looking both ways

because he's already dead.

Then, he taps
on the window

with his grizzly spatula hand.

No!He opens the door...

[ imitates squeaking]

He slowly

approaches the...

[ echoing]:
counter!

And you know what he does next?

What?

You really want to know?

What?

Are you sureyou want to know?

What, what, what does he do?!

He gets you!

[ screams]

[ laughs]

[ screaming continues]

[ laughs]

He get...

Whoo, hoo...

[ laughing]:
Oh, my...

Spongebob, I...

[ screams]

Spongebob, I was...

[ screams]

I was just...

[ screams]

I was just...

[ screaming continues]

Spongebob, I was joking!

What?

It's not true,
none of it's true.

It's not?

Of course not.

Nobody has a spatula
for a hand.

It was all a joke.

Oh.

What a stupid idea.

Who wants a crabby patty
at 3:00 in the morning?

[ alarm rings]

Oh, boy, 3:00 a.m.!

[ munching]

Just look at this place.

It's like a ghost town in here.

[ flickering]

Veryfunny, Spongebob.

What?

"And the lights will flicker
on and off... "

Just like the story, I get it.

Hey, Squidward

how are you doing that
without moving the switch?

I'm not doing it.

It must be the stupid
faulty wiring in here.

This place isn't built to run
24 hours a day.

[ phone rings]

What, what? Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Nice try, Squidward.

Nice try, what?

"The phone will ring and
there will be no one there!"

Oh, you crack me up.

Spongebob, I'm not doing this.

Oh, calm down, calm down.

All right, what was it?

There was... the lights

and the phone.

[ phone rings]

And the walls
will ooze green slime!

Oh, wait.

They always do that.

But what was that third thing?

[ brakes squeak]

I didn't know the
buses ran this late.

They don't.

Well, they're dropping

The HashSlinging Slasher!

[ crying]:
Oh...

At last, you understand;
we're doomed.

No, that's not it.

I am just so touched

that you would
go to the trouble

to dress up as a
ghostly fry cook

and stand on the other
side of the street

just to entertain me.

[ sobbing]:
You must really like me!

Spongebob

there are two problems
with your theory.

One: I hate you.

And two:

How can that be me, when I'm
standing right here?!

[ tapping]

[ screaming]

BOTH:
The HashSlinging Slasher!

[ babbling hysterically]

Aah!He's going
to flip me!

Get away, get away!

Spongebob, no matter

what I've said

I've always sort
of liked you!

Squidward, I used
your clarinet to
unclog my toilet!

Huh?

Get away, get away!

You're not
welcome here!

Can I have a job application?

I brought my own spatula.

I called earlier, but I hung up
'cause I was nervous.

Do you have
references?

Wait, if that was you on
the phone and you on the bus

then who was
flickering the lights?

Nosferatu!

What's that smell?

The register?

Fortynine, oh...

eight?!

That's a penny short!

[ cries]

Oh, no.

Not a penny.

Help! Somebody, help us.

It's just a
penny, sir.

It doesn't
matter.

Doesn't matter?

It's money that makes
the world go round, boy.

It's money

that keeps your pants square.

It's money that keeps Squidward
in frilly soap.

[ sniffing]

Lilac!

It's money that paid
for all them renovations we did.

Oh, nothing

in all the seven seas could
matter more.

Not even that...

Hmm?

...scrumptious, curvy cutie.

I see her, Mr. Krabs.

A crabby patty with cheese.

The classic.

Not the sandwich, boy.

The curvy cutie 
holdingthe sandwich.

SPONGEBOB:
Hey!

That's my driving
teacher, Mrs. Puff.

Mrs.Puff?

Aw, she's married.

Oh, no, Mr. Krabs.

She's single.

Then what happened
to Mr. Puff?

She doesn't like
to talk about it.

Oh, what I wouldn't give

to have a lass like that
on me claw.

Hey, I know!

Why don't I take
you over and
introduce you?

No, no, no,
I'mI'm too old, boy.

Too hardshelled for love.

Besides,
I ain't properly dressed.

Aw...

come on, Mr. Krabs.

You look great.[ fly buzzing]

You wait here while
I go break the ice.

Spongebob, no, wait!

I'm too nervous!

Ooh!

Hi, Mrs. Puff.

[ screaming]:
Ahh!

Hit the brakes, Spongebob.

Watch the tree!

[ screaming]

Wait, Mrs. Puff.

We're not driving.

Oh, I'm sorry, Spongebob.

I didn't expect
to see you here.

I work here,
Mrs. Puff.

Want to meet
my boss?

Well, I'm not...

Don't move.

[ groaning]:
Oh!

Mrs. Puff, I'd like
to introduce you to Mr...

Mrs. Puff, I'd like
to introduce you

to my boss, Mr. Krabs.

Uh... hello.

[ quivering]

Psst! Mr. Krabs,
say hello.

[ muttering]

No, no, Mr. Krabs.

Just say hello.

[ strangled groan]

Hmm, perhaps another time
would be...

[ shouting]:
No!

Wait. He's
trying to tell
you something.

Mr. Krabs...

[ speaking gibberish]

I don't understand.

[ speaking gibberish]

Oh!

I think Mr.
Krabs is saying

that he'd like to...

hit you with a rake.

Goodness!

No!

[ speaking gibberish]

Try to guess
your weight.

Well!

[ speaking gibberish]

No, wait.

He wants to take you...

[ speaking gibberish]

on a date!

Uh!

Is that true, Mr. Krabs?

Do you want to take me
on a date?

Aye.

What do you say?

What do I say?

[ laughs]

I say, you have a way
with words, Mr. Krabs.

I still got it.

[ laughs]

SPONGEBOB: 
Ready for your 
date, Mr. Krabs?

I'm always ready when 
it comes to dating, lad.

SPONGEBOB:
Breath spray?

Check.

Lucky hanky?

Check.

Giant rusty anchor?

Uh, anchor. Anchor?

I can't find me giant
rusty anchor!

Ahh!

Relax, Mr. Krabs.

Just a little joke.

Good luck with youknowwho.

Who's that?

Mrs. Puff.

Oh, yeah.

Well, wish me luck, lad.

MRS. PUFF: 
Oh, Mr. Krabs!

This dinner has been
so wonderful!

The coral was cooked
to perfection.

[ laughs]

I don't think
I could eat another bite.

Oh, I doubt that, my
little shrimp boat.

[ giggles]

You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs.

I mean

foot rubs between courses.

Caricatures.

Imported music.

[ playing lounge music]

Nothing's too good for you,
my prickly peach.

Oh, what I'm trying to tell you,
Mr. Krabs is...

Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy
limousine is here.

Wonderful!

Puffilypoo, your
chariot awaits!

Well...

[ whistles]

[ screaming]
Ahh!

You'll never have to walk again,
my little lobster bib.

[ sighs]:
Aye.

Your bill, sir.

What?!

One hundred dollars!

Well, this can't
possibly be correct.

Oh, my mistake, sir.

Thank you for pointing that out.

Thisis your bill.

[ screaming]

[ crying]

I don't understand,
Mr. Krabs.

How can you spend
$100,000 in one night?

Oh, Spongebob

I couldn't help but spend
every cent I had on her!

I couldn't control myself!

What are you going to do?

I don't know, boy.

I've got another date tomorrow.

I'm caught in the middle
of me two great loves

sweet Mrs. Puff
and the rest of me money.

[ crying]

I wish there was some way
I could help.

Perhaps there is, boy.

I'm putting youin charge
of me money.

I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.

You come with me
on the date

and don't let me spend
any money.

Now remember, we keep it cheap
by going to the park.

And no matter how much
I ask you

you don't give me 
anyof me money.

Now give me a dollar.

Nope.

Good boy!

You'll do fine.

Who is it?

It's me, my
beautiful bell buoy!

[ giggling]

Just a minute.

Flowers!

Flowers, boy!

Go get flowers!

But you said...

Spongebob, you can't call

on a classy lady
like Mrs. Puff emptyhanded.

We ain't talking
about this... or this.

We're talking
about this.

Almost ready.

Hurry, boy, get
the flowers!

Mrs. Puff.

You're as beautiful
as ever.

[ laughs]

That's funny.

I thought I heard
Spongebob's voice.

Uh... you did.

He'll be right back.

He's our personal assistant
for the day.

Oh.

Excuse me.

I have to call
my insurance agent.

My beautiful Puff.

[ sighing]

SPONGEBOB:
Mrs. Krabs...

I got the flowers
you wanted.

What's that?I got the flowers
for Mrs. Puff.

We had an agreement, boy.

You ain't supposed to spend
any of me money.

But you said...

MRS. PUFF:
Here I come!

For you, Mrs. Puff.

Oh, flowers.

Oh, how thoughtful!

And here's a box of chocolates.

Spongebob, where's
the chocolates?

Mr. Krabs, the budget
doesn't allow for...

[ whispering]:
Spongebob, you can't go
to Mrs. Puff's house

without chocolates.

Hurry, hurry!

I bought the biggest box
they had.

Buy, buy, buy.

Spend, spend, spend.

Is that all you
can think about?

Oh, Eugene!

Here's those chocolates
I bought for you.

What are we doing today,
Mrs. Puff?

Dinner? Dancing?

A trip to the moon?

Psst! Mr. Krabs...

we're just going for a walk
in the park, remember?

Actually, a
walk in the park
sounds perfect.

It's a beautiful day.

I'll just need
to get a sun hat and...

Mrs. Puff needs a
sun hat, Spongebob.

Oh, I think she...

The sun is beating
down on poor Mrs.
Puff's head.

As your financial advisor,
I suggest...

There's not time
for suggestions.

Go buy a hat!

But...Today!

Don't worry, Mrs. Puff.

I'll shade you.

Spongebob, hurry!

One shady hat.

Good job, that.

Oh, well... thank you

but you didn't need
to buy one.

I have a hat in the closet.

Didn't need
to buy one!

You hear that, boy?

We didn't need
to buy a hat.

Aren't you supposed
to be saving me money?

I'm trying, Mr. Krabs

but you keep telling me
to buy things for Mrs. Puff.

It's all really confusing.

Spongebob, I'm sorry.

This is my fault.

I'm not thinking
clearly.

I'm making a sailor's promise,
boy.

From this moment on

I won't ask you to buy anything
for Mrs. Puff.

Spongebob, Mrs. Puff needs
a new fur coat!

[ breathing heavily]

You're spending all me money!

Puffy needs a new pair of shoes.

[ breathing heavily]

You're breaking me, boy!

She needs fine jewelry!

[ panting]

Not that fine!

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

[ repeating]:
Spongebob! Spongebob...

[ gasping]

Spongebob, I'm glad
I caught you.

I want you to
buy Mrs. Puff...

Wait!

Don'ttell me!

You want me to run down
to the store

and buy Mrs. Puff something
she doesn't need.

Then you want me
to run back here

so you can say,
"Aye, Spongebob.

You're spending all me money."

And then I'll say

"But Mr. Krabs,
I'm only doing what you said!"

Then you'll say

"We're not talking
about this or this.

We're talking about this!"

[ gasping]

But lad, this
time's different.

Mrs. Puff 
needsthis.

Are we going to the park soon?

Please, lad?

I'm begging you.

I'm a lonely old
crustacean

who's found love.

Don't let me
lose her.

[ crying]

Mr. Krabs, don't.

Don't cry, Mr. Krabs.

Come on.

Okay, I'm going to get it, see?

Cheer up, Mr. Krabs.

Here's that washing machine
you wanted.

Cheer up?

How can I cheer up...

when you're spending all
me hardearned cash?!

See? You just did it again!

Lad, I can't help it

if you're loose with
other people's money.

Do you think Mrs. Puff
will need a dryer

to go along with that?

Well, Mr. Krabs

do you want to know
what I think?

[ Spongebob screaming 
in gibberish]

Mr. Krabs.

[ speaking gibberish]

Oh.

Mr. Krabs' wallet.

[ muttering]

I didn't know
Spongebob had such
a colorful vocabulary.

Actually, there's
something I'd like to
say, too, Mr. Krabs.

I'm afraid I
just don't feel
comfortable

accepting all
these gifts.

I'd rather go dutch.

If you don't mind.

Okay.

You're a very sweet man,
Mr. Krabs.

Oh!

[ bell ringing]

MRS. PUFF: 
Okay, class, quiet, quiet.

Now, get out your
pencils and paper

and write down
the assignment.

[ class groans]

Did you hear that?

We get an assignment.

Everyone must write an essay
on what notto do

at a stoplight.

[ all groaning]

Did you hear that?

What not to do
at a stoplight!

In no less than 800 words!

[ squeal of delight]

[ all groaning]

Did you hear that?
800 words?!

Yeah, I know!

Due tomorrow.

And remember, class:
work hard and no goofing off.

SPONGEBOB: 
Okay, Gary, no goofing off!

I am about to write
the greatest essay

of all time.

Like most great essays,
it will be written

on paper.

Even more important
than the paper is...

the pencil.

[ bell dings]

A pencil is sharp or as dull
as I like.

Hmm, funny, as my ideas grow,
you shrink.

[ chuckles]

Well, I couldn't have asked

for a more beautiful day
to write an essay.

[ birds chirping]

Okay, here we go.

"What Not To Do
At A Stoplight."

Hey, this is easy.

"By SpongeBob Squarepants."

Ha! This essay is pure gold.

And now, pencil,
get ready to do your stuff

because herewe go.

[ ticking]

Gee...

this is harder than I thought.

[ children laughing ]

Come on, SpongeBob!

It should be against the law
to have to write an essay

on such a super sailorific,
sunshiny day!

Oh!

But I must press onward,

because with this pencil and the
completion of this essay,

I'll be one step closer
to my driver's license!

[ tires squealing ]

Oh, yeah.

This'll be no problemo.

Why, I got plenty of time.
It's only 6:00.

[ ticking ]

Okay... okay, here we go.

Here we go.

Ahh!

I know, I just need to get

a little blood pumpin'
in the old noodle.

How about some calisthenics?

Huphoo! Huphoo!
Huphoo! Huphoo!

Huphoo! Huphoo! 
Huphoo! Huphoo!

Huphoo! Huphoo! 
Huphoo! Huphoo!

Ah, I can feel
those juices pumpin' now!

[ gurgling laughter]

Hey! What am I doing?!

I got to write that paper!

[ grunting]

Come on, pencil, make words.

[ meow]

Gary!

Hey, hey, hey

Gary, how's my favorite mollusk?

How about
you let ol' SpongeBob

fix you up
something to eat?

[ meows]

What do you mean,
you're not hungry?

[ meows]

I know I have
an essay to write!

Now come on, Gary!

[ grunts]

I got to make sure
you get your nutrition

so I'm not leaving
until you eat every single bite.

[ loud chomp, gulp]

[ burps]

[ squishy slithering]

Gary, aare you sure
you don't want

some crème brulée?

Oror some chocoflavored
algae bits?

[ squishes]

Gee, Gary sure made a mess.

I can't work on my essay

knowing there's a mess
in the kitchen.

[ squeaking]

Hmm...

I might as well clean
the rest of the floor

while I'm at it.

[ squeaking and whistling]

[ groaning]:
I should get
these hardtoreach places, too.

And these dishes
need to be cleaned.

Can't have dirty garbage.

[ clinking]

Well, I think
it's clean enough now.

[ bell tinkling]

Why, that didn't take too long.
It's only...

10:00!

Oh!

No more fooling around.

I got to get back to work.

Okay, Mr. Essay, I say

prepare to be written!

[ divebomber whooshing]

[ loud thud]

I'm doing it!

I'm doing it!

Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

And some of these...
and some of these...

Almost there and...

[ sighs]

Now let's see
how it looks so far.

"The..."

Break time!

Pacing always helps me think.

Let's see, only 799 words to go.

Think, SpongeBob, think!

[ snorting]

[ loud ringing]

[ gasping]:
WWho's that?!
Wha...? Hello?

Hey, Patrick, what you up to?

Sleeping.

That's really fascinating.

Are you having a good sleep?

Any dreams you'd like
to discuss?

I remember on the...

SpongeBob?

You and I both know
that you're just using me

as a distraction

so you don't have to write
your essay.

[ gasping, stammering]

That is nottrue!

I called to have an engaging
conversation with you.

Well, I'm listening.

Uh... Marco...

Polo.

[ dial tone]

Yeah, well,
I got to get going, Patrick.

Got an important essay to write.

Sheesh, what a chatterbox.

Can't he see that I'm busy?

[ chair squeaks]

I can't write
with all these eraser shavings

all over my paper.

[ grunts]

Now they're floating
around my thinking space.

[ inhales deeply]

So long, pesky particles.

[ twittering squeaks]

[ grunting]

[ choking]

[ gulps, gasps]

I swallowed one!

I'm choking!

[ coughing]:
Water!

Water!

[ frantic gulping]

[ gasping]

That was a close one.

[ meows]

What do you mean

overly dramatic,
Gary?

All that choking
sure made me hungry.

[ meows]

I can't write on an
empty stomach, Gary.

I got to have my brain food.

Now, let's see...
white or rye bread?

Or pumpernickel?

Gee, I guess it really depends
on the meat inside...

and the cheese.

[ doorbell rings]

A visitor?

For me?!

Hello.

Package for
Mr. Squarepants.

Great!

Thanks!

So, uh, you like
delivering mail?

It puts bread on the table.

Rye or pumpernickel?

[ obnoxious laughter]

Oh, brother.

So, do you deliver
your own mail

or do you have
your own mailperson?

But then who delivers 
hismail?

Is there a neverending
chain of mailmen

delivering mail
to other mailmen?

Well, I guess a P.O. box

could, in theory,
break the chain...

Don't you have
a paper to write?

[ gulps]

How did he know I'm supposed
to be writing an essay?

[ blipping]

[ slams]

In other news

local resident
SpongeBob Squarepants

What have I done?!

Help!

Help, my house is on fire!

[ jabbering]

[ brakes squeal]

SpongeBob, why?!

Why did you set me
on fire, SpongeBob?

Why didn't you just
write your essay?!

Stop wasting time!

[ gasps]

[ pops]

Where's my essay?

Oh, there you are.

[ laughing]

I must have dozed off.

Let's see, where are we?

Do I dare look at the clock?

[ creaking]

[ ticking]

[ gasping]:
It's almost 9:00!

Class starts in five minutes!

How am I going to write
this whole paper

in five minutes?!

How am I supposed to know
what not to do at a stoplight?

Feeding your snail
is something not to do

at a stoplight...

and making a sandwich
andand lighting candles

and drinking water
and calling your friends

and karate chopping the TV

and shooting the breeze
with the mailman

and falling asleep and...

[ panting heavily]

Mrs. Puff!

Mrs. Puff, I'm finished!

All 800 words!

I'm finished!
Here it is!

They... Mrs. Puff?

Where is everybody?

Oh, there you are,
SpongeBob.

Here you go,
Mrs. Puff.

800 words, all about stoplights
and what not to do at them.

I'm sorry, SpongeBob,
I tried to call you.

I have to go
to a teachers' convention.

But what about
my essay?

I decided to cancel
the assignment.

We're just going to take
a field trip

to a stoplight instead.

See you next week.

[ grunting]

[ knocking]

[ grunts]

Whoo!

[ grunting]

[ panting]

Oh, sweep, sweep.

Need... furniture!

[ panting and gasping]

Patrick, what's
with the home improvement?

[ barks]

[ panting]

Hey, Patrick!

Ooh, sweep, sweep!

Well, Patrick, I came
over to see

if you wanted to go
jelly fishing

but I can see you're busy
having an episode.

You know something,
Spongebob?

it's just all fun and games
for you.

Nothing really matters.

[ mockingly]:
"Oh, let's go jelly fishing!

"We don't have any work to do.

"Life is just a big bowl
of fancy, assorted cashews

"and nobody has anything
to dust or to clean

or to wipe, or fabricate!"

But, Patrick, the only thing
I've ever seen you clean

is your plate.

[ sobbing]

I don't know what to do,
Spongebob.

You got to help me!

Patrick, you forgot
how to eat again.

Come on, we'll
get the funnel.

No, it's not that,
Spongebob; it's worse.

Darn, I like
the funnel.

Well, what is it then?

Look!

Hey, a note.

Yeah, but turn it over.

There's a letter.

You're right.

And I got this message
from my parents.

Your parents?

"Dear Patrick,
Your mom and I

"are coming out tomorrow
for Starfish Day.

"Please try to remember,
but don't try too hard

"or you'll hurt yourself
like last time.

Love, Daddy."

Spongebob, my parents think
I'm dumber

than a sack of diapers.

No, they don't,
Patrick.

Parents just like
to push your buttons...

like thisNee!

[ laughing]

That always cheers me up.

But not today.

Patrick, if your parents
think you're dumb

then they must not know
what dumb really is.

But don't they watch
television?

That's what I'm saying, Pat.

If your parents got to meet
a real dummy

they'd realize what genius
you really are.

Oh, but don't genius live
in a lamp?

And besides, we don't know
any dumb people.

Don't worry, Patrick.

I'll be the dummy!

When your parents see
how dumb I act

they'll think you're
the smartest guy ever.

Math is power!

A, B, C, D

E, F, G...[ doorbell rings]

Oh! ...H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

Should I get the bullhorn
again, Marty?

...W, X, Y and Z?

Hi, Mom.

Hi, Dad.

Son, you recognized us
this time.

Why wouldn't I recognize
my own parents?

You never were a bright one.

Uh...

[ laughing]

Well, aren't you going
to show us inside?

He probably forgot
where it is.

I know where...

Oh, let me lead the way
so we don't get lost, huh?

Hold hands now.

Okay, we're almost there.

Let go on three.

One, two, three.

Good job!

Pats for Patrick.Pats for Patrick.

[ both laughing]

I'll go get the beverages.

[ ice cubes tinkling]

Wow, son!

You put the drinks insomething
this time.

Aw, son, you must've been
working all night

to put these together
for us.

We love you.
We love you.

[ groaning]

[ doorbell rings]Hooray, the idiot's here!

I mean, I'll get it.

Protective helmetcheck.

[ meows]

I'm supposed
to look stupid, Gary.

[ meows]

What could go wrong?

What a surprise.

Hi.

Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor,
Spongebob.

Hi.

Hello there.

How do you do?

Hi.

Put her there.

[ mechanical voice]:
Mama, Mama!

He means shake.

No, Spongebob, no!

Shake hands.

No, Spongebob.

Grab my dad's hand.

Grab it with
only one hand.

Good boy!

Now move your
arm up and down.

[ giggling]

So, Spongebob,
do you live nearby?

Hi.

No, Spongebob.
Show them your house.

No, not your blouse,
your house.

[ screaming]

He lives in a fruit?

That's unhealthy.

[ laughing]

Hey, Spongebob!

You want to stay
for dinner?

[ babbling]

[ chuckles]

Does he always do that
after he eats?

PATRICK:
Only on Wednesday.

[ buzzing loudly]

[ chuckling]

Uh, Patrick, I think your friend
might be broken.

Yeah, and it would take
more than some masking tape

to fix that guy.

[ siren blares]

Whoa! Is he going to be okay?

Oh, that's nothing.

You should see him
in the morning

prancing around, yelling,
"Harmony! Harmony! Harmony!

He drives
all the neighbors crazy.

Why, just the other day
our neighbor Squidward was...

[ elephant trumpets]

[ clattering]

There's really
no help for him.

I mean, look at
the way he's dressed.

Only somebody with holes
drilled in their head

would wear that stuff.

And how about this shape?

I mean, I've heard
of barrelchested

but never boxchested!

[ all laughing]

Hey, Spongebob, do you have
any mascara I could borrow?

[ chuckles]

The boy wears makeup?

What a card!

[ laughing]

[ laughter continues]

Hey, Patrick.

Patrick!

Aw, he said my name.

Wow, how'd you train
him to do that?

[ laughter]

Ow! He bit me.

Patrick,
meet me in the kitchen.

Oh, I guess the dummy
wants to have a private
conversation.

[ laughing]

A dumb one!

[ laughing]

So, what's on your mind?

No, wait!

I already know the answer:
nothing.

[ laughing]

See, that's funny,
'cause you're dumb!

Patrick, could you let up
on the insults

just a little bit?

Oh, we're those too complicated
for you?

I'll try dumbingthem down
a bit.

Patrick, I get the feeling
that you think I really am dumb.

[ chuckling]:
That's just what I'd expect
you to say.

Dumb people are always
blissfully unaware

of how dumb they really are.

[ moans]

I'm only pretending to be dumb.

It was our plan, remember?

Oh, Spongebob, if only
you could see

how stupid you sound right now

with your talk
of imaginary plans.

Tell you what, you've caught me
in a good mood.

I'll humor you.

Go on. Go out there and act
smart for everyone.

Okay, I will.

Andand don't worry;
I'll keep this warm for you.

[ clears throat]

I have a confession to make.

I lied about being stupid.

I just acted like a fool

so you would appreciate Patrick
a little bit more.

I know how to talk and eat
and do laundry

I even separate the darks
and the lights.

So what do you say we start over
and try again.

Hi. My name is
Spongebob Squarepants

and I am not a dummy.

[ chuckling]

Amazing. Three minutes
in the kitchen

and our son has taught him
to talk in complete sentences.

Oh, good work, son.

It wasn't easy, Dad.

[ stuttering]:
Bbutbut...

It looks like it's time
for your next lesson, young man.

Now listen to me!
I'm not dumb!

I have a brain.
See, here's a picture of it.

That must be actual size.

[ laughter]

No! It's normal size
and fully functional.

Watch.

Two plus two equals four.

Oh, son, you taught him math,
too.

No!

Andyou taught him to sing.

[ babbling]

Oh, now he's
shortcircuiting.

You must've taught him
a little too much.

[ laughing]

[ laughter continues]

[ laughter continuing]

[ screaming]

You know, son

I've always known
that when it comes to brightness

well, you're about a threewatt.

But this guy... he's a wet match
in a dark cave.

He makes
phone operators seem smart.

[ clears throat]
But more importantly, son

he's shown me what a sharp,
quickwitted boy you've become.

II feel like I'm
really meeting you
for the first time.

Isn't that right, Janet?

You bet, Marty.

Janet?

Marty?!

Who are you people?!

Marty, I'm scared.

[ doorbell rings]

Excuse me.

Does this lovely
couple belong to you?

They've been standing
outside my house saying

"Where's Patrick?" all day.

It's driving me nuts!

Mom! Dad!

Wow, son, you actually
recognized us this time.

And you remembered
to get dressed today.

[ all laughing]

Oh, that's right, honey,
we don't have a son.

Oh, yeah.

[ laughter continuing]

[ Krabs sighs]

Well, it's the worst time
of the day once again.

[ sadly]:
Closing time.

Well, see you
in the a.m., Mr. Krabs.

Hold on there,
SpongeBob.

Take that pile
of filth out
with you.

[ gasps]:
Mr. Krabs

you shouldn't talk
about Squidward like that.

He means this filth, you loon.

Mm, taking out the trash,
taking out the trash.

Hmm, dumpster writing!

The voice of the people.

"Up with bubbles,
down with air."

[ laughs]

"Nematodes are people, too."

Ha, those nematodes.

Here's one somebody
didn't finish:

"Squidward smells."

"Good."

Hmm, what's this one?

"Krabs is a..."

Hmm?

"Krabs is a..."

[ dolphin chirps]

Do you kiss
your mother
with that mouth?

Well, sometimes,
but not... recently.

PATRICK:
Hi, garbage man.

Hi, SpongeBob.

Hi, Patrick.

Hey, Patrick,
do you know

what this
word means?

[ slowly]:
"Krabs..."

Uh, isn't that
the red, sweaty guy
you work for?

SPONGEBOB:
Nuhuh, not
that word.

Thatword.

[ dolphin chirps]

Hey!

I think I know
what that means.

That's one of those
sentence enhancers.

Sentence enhancers?

You use them
when you want
to talk fancy.

You just sprinkle it
over anything you say

and whamo!

You got yourself
a spicy sentence
sandwich.

Oh, I get it.

Let me try.

[ clears throat]

Hello, Patrick.

Lovely [ dolphin chirps]
day we're having

isn't it?

Why, yes, it
is, SpongeBob.

This [ dolphin 
chirps] day

is particularly
[ dolphin chirps]
lovely.

How [ dolphin chirps]
right you are, Patrick.

[ dolphin chirps]

[ dolphin chirps]

[ dolphin chirps]

Ooh, you're right, Patrick.

My lips are tingling from the
spiciness of this conversation.

Oohhoo, mine, too.

[ spluttering and laughing]

[ both laughing]

It tingles
when I laugh.

[ whistling]

Hello, customers.

Nice [ dolphin chirps] day
we're having, huh?

[ gasps]

Did he just say...

Aye, he did.

Hey, Patrick, how
the [ dolphin chirps]
are you?

Pretty [ dolphin chirps]
good, SpongeBob.

I thought this was a restaurant,
not a guttermouth convention.

[ feedback]

Attention, customers.

[ over intercom]:
Today's special

is a [ dolphin chirps]
crabby pattie

served in a greasy
[ dolphin chirps] sauce

and grilled to [ dolphin 
chirps] perfection.

And, don't forget to ask us
to [ dolphin chirps]

the [ dolphin chirps] fries.

It'll be our [ dolphin chirps]
pleasure.

Hi, Squidward.

How the [ dolphin chirps]
are you?

Nice [ dolphin 
chirps] day

isn't it,
Squidward?

I don't understand.

That guy's talented.

He doesn't have
to work blue.

Let's go somewhere
more family oriented.

[ customers 
complaining angrily]

[ siren wails]

Huh?

[ gasps]

The Krusty Krab!

She's empty!

All hands on deck!

Batten the
front doors!

Brace the cash
register!

Break out
the happy snacks!

Squidward!

Where have all me
beautiful paying
customers gone?

Apparently the
two barnacle
mouth brothers

just learned
a new word

and SpongeBob
just said it
over the intercom.

Well, what was it?
What did he say?

Uh, he said, uh, well,
he said...

[ whispering]

Huh?

[ whispering]

[ gasps]

SpongeBob
and friend!

Front and center!

Why, I ought to make
the two of you paint
the Krusty Krab

for using
such language!

But, Mr. Krabs

we were only using
our sentence enhancers.

Yeah, it's fancy talk.

There ain't nothing fancy
about that word!

You mean,
[ dolphin chirps]?

Yes, that one!

Now, quit
saying that.

It's a bad word.

BOTH:
Bad word?!

[ moaning]

Yes, siree.

That's bad word number 11.

In fact, there are 13 bad words

you should
never use.

Don't you mean
there are
only seven?

Not if you're
a sailor.

[ chuckles]

Wow, 13.

That's a lot of
[ dolphin chirps]
bad words.

Okay, boys, I want you
to promise me

you'll never use
that word again.

We promise.We promise.

SPONGEBOB:
Gee, I sure am glad
Mr. Krabs told us

that word we
were using was
a bad word.

Yeah, me, too

because classy sophisticates
like us

should not stain our lips
with cursing.

Yea, verily.

Now let's play
a nice, wholesome game

of Eels
and Escalators.

Oh, boy, my favorite!

Come on, Gary needs
a new pair of shoes.

Ooh, eels.

Too bad, SpongeBob.

You got to ride the eel.

Darn.

My turn!

Hooray!

Escalators!

[ laughs heartily]

Up, up, up!

Come on, escalators,
escalators, escalators.

[ sighs]

Eels again.

My turn!

Escalators!

Escalators, escalators,
escalators.

Eels?!

Eskeelators!

Well, this is
your last chance, SpongeBob.

Oh, if you get
eels again, you lose.

Ooh...

escalators, escalators,
escalators!

Ha! Escalators!

Eels.

Bah!

[ dolphin chirps]

Ohhhhh.

You said number 11.

III didn't mean...

You got to
understand, Patrick.

I was trying...

What I meant
to say...

Some things
just slip out.

You got to
understand.

Don't worry,
SpongeBob.

I understand.

Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!

Patrick!
Patrick, no!

Please don't tell.

But you said
[ dolphin chirps].

Aha!

Now I'm going to tell
Mr. Krabs on you!

Not if I tell first!

I can run faster
than you.

[ laughs]

See you at
the Krusty Krab!

[ laughs]

Oh, no!

[ laughs]

Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!

What, what, what?

Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!

Yes, yes, yes?

He said,
he said...

Out with it, boy!

We were playing
Eels and Escalators

and he was going up,
and I rode the eel.

Then we ran, and Patrick
said some things.

What things?

Well, he said...

Yes?

Well, he said
a certain word

that you said
he shouldn't say

and this particular
word happens to be
word number 11

in a list of 13 words
that you said shouldn't
be said.

Uh, right.

What was that part
about the, uh...
who now?

Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!

[ sighs]

BOTH:
He said that word

you said
he shouldn't!

[ both yelling]

Now I'm going to let go
of your lips

and when I do, I want you
to calmly tell me

what youse need to tell me,
understand?

Mmhmm.Mmhmm.

BOTH:
He said [ dolphin chirps].

[ gasps]

Do my ears deceive me?

You two should be ashamed!

Time to take out
the trash.

You two need to be
taught a lesson.

I thought I made it clear.

Neverand I mean never
use number 11

or any of the 13 bad words.

Now, the both of youse
wait right here.

I'll be back.

What's going
to happen to us?

We'll probably get 40 lashes.

Oh, no!

I'm sorry, Patrick.

Mr. Krabs
is right.

There's no need
for words like that.

I'm sorry, too,
SpongeBob.

Let's make
a vow, Patrick.

From this day forth

a foul word shall
never pass our lips.

We will be
good citizens

just like good old
Mr. Krabs.

Agreed.

KRABS:
All right, you
two foul mouths.

As punishment for fouling
the air in me restaurant

with your foul words

you're going to give
the Krusty Krab

a fresh coat of paint
from top to bottom.

Woo! Wow! Oh!

Whoa!

My [ dolphin chirps] foot!

What [ dolphin chirps] genius

put a [ dolphin chirps] rock
in a path!

I got a [ horn honks]
foot here!

Oh
[ seal 
barks]!

[ hornbeeps]

[ seagull 
caws]

...Five, six...

...Side of [ dolphin chirps]

and a helping of [ honk]...

Nine.

Aw, [ seal barks]

[ seagull caws] grabbin'...

[ foghorn 
blows]

That's all 13, Patrick.

[ gasps]

We're going to tell
your mom, Mr. Krabs.

No, please!

Not my mommy!

Wait!

Please don't tell
me mother!

I don't think
her little old
heart can take it!

BOTH:
Mama Krabs! Mama Krabs!

Well, hello there.

Mama Krabs, he said
[ dolphin chirps]

and then he said
[ dolphin chirps] again

and he said
[ seal barks]

and then he screamed
[ foghorn blows]

and he [ airhorn 
honks] Mrs. Krabs.

He didn't care.

Such a stream of
[ seagull caws]

[ foghorn blasts, 
bell dings]

I have never heard
in my days.

Oh, dear.

My poor, old heart.

[ gasps]

Oh, dear mother.

What have these
foulmouthed heathens

done to you?

You two should be
ashamed.

Making an old lady faint
with your sailor talk.

You should all
be ashamed.

And if you're going
to talk like sailors

then you're going
to work like sailors.

I guess you scalawags
have earned a glass of lemonade.

[ laughs, imitating Popeye]

Yeeow!

My [ horn blasts] foot!

[ gasps][ gasps]

Mother!

What?

It's old man Jenkins
and his jalopy.

[ horn blasts]

Howdy, Mrs. K.!

[ laughing as horn blasts]

SQUIDWARD: 
Oh, how I have dreamed

of this day...

"Mr. Tentacles,
Professor of Art."

What a marvelous opportunity
for the people of Bikini Bottom.

Bring me your huddled masses
of bored housewives

and I will shape them
in my image.

I'll go down in history.

Someday, there will be
a wing with my name on it

in all the museums of the world!

Dude, you're
teaching art at
the rec center.

Calm down.

Uncultured trash urchin.

9:00 a.m.

Time to let the class in.

Well, don't want to keep
them waiting any longer.

I'm so excited
about this...

Welcome to art class!

Oh, isn't this
"Cooking"?

Sorry.

Oh, never mind.

Hi, Squidward.

Are you taking
this art class, too?

SpongeBob?

In art class!

Wait! This 
isCooking.

Come back!

You've got
to be kidding.

This is great!

You and me
in school together.

So, where's
the teacher?

You're looking at him.

You are the "Teacher"

to my "Pupil"?

This isn't art class.

It's heaven.

Yeah.

Grab a little piece of heaven

and let's get on with it.

I'm ready... Mr. Tentacles.

So... you want to be
an artist, eh, SpongeBob?

Yes, please.

Well, art is not
all fun and games.

It's a lot of hard work.

Okay, first, repeat after me.

I have no talent.

I have no talent.

Mr. Tentacles
has all the talent.

Mr. Tentacles has
all the talent.

If I'm lucky, some
of Mr. Tentacles' talent

may rub off on me.

If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will
rub his tentacles on my art.

Whatever.

Okay, since you're telling me
you have no prior training

we'll have to start
from square one

or should I say, circle one?

[ chuckles]

Am I going too fast
for you, SpongeBob?

How's this, Squidward?

What the...
how the...

A perfect circle?

Do it again.

Show your process.

Well, first
I draw this head.

Then I erased some of
the more detailed features.

And one, two, three...

a circle thingy.

Give me that.

Forget the circles!

Oh, nice one, Squidward.

Let me try.

Oh, lookey, Squidward.

It's you and me
playing leapfrog.

That's you on the bottom.

Give me that.

There is nothing
artistic about leapfrog.

What are you
doing now?

I call it rippy bits.

You take a bunch
of old, rippedup paper

and you make
a new picture.

See, you're on...
top... this time.

Do you want to learn
art or not?

I'm sorryI'll listen.

All right, SpongeBob,
pay close attention.

Look at your marble.

Visualize the sculpture within.

Then... gently...

How's this, Squidward?

It's beautiful.

I mean...

This isn't
a sculpture!

A good sculpture
takes... more time.

You can't just
sculpt willynilly.

You've got to go by the book...

follow the rules.

Otherwise you'll
never get past
amateur hour here.

Besides, you got
the nose wrong.

There.

Now it's art.

Oh, it's so obvious.

I would have never
thought of that.

I'm sorry, Squidward.

I came here to learn

and I arrogantly
shunned your lessons.

I'll never be a great
artist like you.

I don't deserve
your tutoring.

I don't deserve to be
in your presence.

I don't even deserve
to use your doors.

Hello, there.

SPONGEBOB:
But I did deserve that.

I deserved that, too.

And I deserve this.

Good day, sir.

Sorry, class is dismissed.

You're too late.

Oh, I beg your pardon

but I'd forgotten my manners.

My name is Monty P. Moneybags.

The worldfamous art collector?

The one and only.

Well, what are
you doing here?

I'm on a shopping spree

buying art for
my new museum.

Your search is over.

I am Bikini Bottom's
greatest artiste.

I call this one 
Squidward in Repose.

I... don't think
that will fit in

with the other pieces
in my collection.

Why not?

Because it's an artcollection.

[ laughs]

How about this one?

I call it Bold and Brash.

More like... 
Belongs in the Trash.

[ laughing]

Sorry, I must have
missed that one.

[ sighs]

Maybe I should be...

Huh?

What is that?!

Wait, wait.

That's not...

Angelic form.

Amazing detail.

Perfect censorship.

This is the work
of a true genius.

Hello.

What's this?

This is the only flaw.

Ah... that's more like it.

I simply must find
the artist responsible.

He shall have fame.

Fame.

Fortune.

Fortune.

Anything his heart
desires.

Anything?

It's me.

It's me.

I'm responsible.

I can see it now...
your name

in the world's most
prestigious museums.

I am going to make
you immortal!

Now, help me get
this in the car.

I could use a little help.

My fame!

My fortune!

My hair!

Well, that's
a bit of bad luck
right there.

But this shouldn't
be a problem

for an artist
of your magnitude.

You can whip up
another one.

Yeah... no problem.

You know,
between you and me

this isn't
my best work.

Why don't you come
back tomorrow

and I'll have
something

that will really
knock your socks off?

Between you and me,
I'm not wearing socks.

Yeah, no socks.

That's fine, but...

Okay, see you tomorrow.

Bye.

I've got to find SpongeBob!

SpongeBob.

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob!

SPONGEBOB:
Go away,
Squidward.

I don't deserve your kindness.

Hey, cheer up.

I have decided to give you
another chance.

Why, with a great
teacher like me

anything is possible.

Don't look at me,
Squidward.

Don't look
at my shame.

These hands weren't
meant to create.

They only destroy.

I can't look at them.

Oh, come on, SpongeBob.

You've got yourself a pair
of yellow dandies here

and with my help

we'll turn them
into tools of beauty.

Really?

Really.

Really?

Really.

Really?

Really.

Wow.

Really?

Let's go.

Squidward, look!

It's old Bold and Brash.

Give me that.

Okay, SpongeBob.

Just do what
you did before.

I can't.

Wait, wait.

Let me help.

Let's start with
the circle again.

I did it, Squidward.

Huh?

But what about the head

and the erasing, and the...

I don't know...
that stuff's not in the book.

Uh...

How about this, huh?

Remember?

That's not in
the book either.

Forget about the book!

Look at all this
mess, SpongeBob.

What do all these
little bits of paper

make you want to do?

Wait, I know this.

Oh, wait, I think I got it.

There you go.

Yes! Tadah!

Okay, SpongeBob.

Let's just move on
to the marble.

First, an artist
must concentrate

and visualize his concept.

Now you've got it.

I've got to embrace the marble.

Right.

I've got to sniff the marble.

Well... okay.

I've got to lick the marble.

Uh...

I've got to wash the marble.

I've got to date the marble.

I've got to bethe marble.

I've got it!

I have seen
the sculpture within.

Here you go,
Buddy.

With this tool,
I shall give birth to art.

Oh, boy.

One more thing.

There.

Now it's art.

Well, what do you
think, Squidward?

Just take it all in
for a moment.

Let it soak in.

[ squawking and screeching]

It looks like the excitement
of my artistic triumph

is too much for Squidward.

Oh, well, back to the dump.

To the dump, to the dump,
to the dump, dump, dump

To the dump, to the dump,
to the dump, dump, dump.

[ squawking and screeching]

I'm here for the...

What the...

Who's responsible
for this?!

As of now, it's 
hisresponsibility.

Good day to you, sir!

You, sir, are

the greatest artist

who ever lived!

Ah... another beautiful day

in Bikini Bottom's 
own Jellyfish Fields

an untamed world 
of natural order

where the little jellyfish 
jellies roam free

across the salty seascape.

And where there is jellyfish, 
there is the jellyfish hunter.

[ lala'ing]

You're my 12th catch of the day.

I'm going to call you Twelvy.

Kitchykitchykoo.

Bye, Twelvy.

[ jellyfish buzzing]

Oh... it's you.

you and me again.

jellyfish in this field

at least once, except you,
Noname.

[ making nasal whine]

[ can clanking]

[ panting]

[ panting faster

Gotcha!

Barnacles, how did he do that?

Some day I'll catch ol' Noname.

I'm going on
my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.

You got five minutes!

Wow, one more minute
than yesterday!

SpongeBob ready for launch.

[ imitating rocket launch]

Mmm...

Oh, yum...

Mmm...

Oh, yeah...

[ tittering]

[ swallows]

Hey, buddy, what
the heck is that?

Why, this is a hole, good sir.

You see, I am a sponge,
and we typically...

Not that, that!

It's just
a little old crabby patty

smothered in jellyfish jelly.

I call it a "crabby patty
with jellyfish jelly."

Could I try some?

Sure!

Amazing...

I've got to tell
someone about this.

Hey,
all you people...

Hey, all you people...

Hey, all you people,
won't you listen to me?

I just had a sandwich,
no ordinary sandwich

A sandwich filled
with jellyfish jelly!

Hey, man, you got
to try this sandwich

It's no
ordinary sandwich

It's the tastiest sandwich
in the sea!

[ scat singing]

Yeah...

Thank you.

SpongeBob?!

Who's playing Squidward's
records again?!

No one, Mr. Krabs.

I was just sharing my jellyfish
jelly with the customers.

ALL:
Mmm...

Here, Mr. Krabs,
send your taste buds
on a journey.

Messin' with the patty's
formula... that's mutiny!

Why, I ought to...

Sir, this is
the greatest thing

I've ever eaten.

I'm going to come
back here for lunch

every day for the rest
of my life.

Hey, buddy, you all right?

[ stuttering]

You okay, Mr. K.?

SpongeBob, I got a
proposition for you:

How's about
you go catch me

some of those
little money fish?

Oh, boy, getting paid
to jellyfish

that's my life's dream.

Well, keep dreamin'
this'll be on your time.

Aye, aye, sir.

Now, go get me some jellyfish

and make it...

[ jellyfish humming]

Quick.

Uh... SpongeBob

we're going
to need more

than one
puny jellyfish.

But, sir, how many
jellyfish do you need?

SpongeBob, we have
a whole ecosystem

full of hungry
payin' customers.

Oh, no! Don't tell me...

you've stopped carin'
for the customers.

[ screams]

No, never.

Then go out there

and get me
some more jellies!

Okay, Mr. Krabs.

Just make sure
the jellyfish
are comfortable;

they are
oh, so sensitive.

Oo, I'll keep them
comfortable all right...

Oh, that'll

It feels like somebody...

wants to tell me something!

[ groans]

I told you
he was on to us.

[ panting]

[ buzzing]

I'm not interested
in anything you're selling!

[ panting frantically]

Gee, it sure felt like...

Bah! I must be working too hard.

[ phone ringing]

I'll get it, Gary.

Hello, SpongeBob's house,
SpongeBob speaking.

[ heavy breathing]

Hello?

[ heavy breathing]

[ dial tone buzzing]

Uh, uh, a wrong number.

Uh, I guess Gary forgot
to pay the electric bill.

[ laughs nervously]

[ clanking]

Gary, is that you?

Gary?!

Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary.

There's probably some candles
in the kitchen.

Hello... what's this?

How did you get in here,
oh, delicious one?

A little snack
will calm my nerves.

Mmm, a crabby patty
with blue jelly.

[ gasps]

Blue jelly?!

[ yells]

Hello, Noname,
what's happening?

[ laughs nervously]

Noname, let me out.

What are you going
to do with me?

PU, what smells
like big business?

Hey, I don't remember
that factory.

Huh?

Oh, what is
this horrible place?!

MECHANICAL VOICE:
Kitchykitchykoo.

What kind of monster
is responsible for this horror?

That's it, boys, keep that
gelatinous gold aflowin'.

[ chortles]

Mr. Krabs?

No.

Now I know why
you brought me here.

But what can we do?

[ music playing]

SPONGEBOB:
Mr. Krabs?

Stops this madness!

Stop it right now!

Uh, uh... this isn't what it
looks like, SpongeBob.

Why, uh, we're just, uh, uh,
having a little tea party.

Oh, boy, a tea party.

You tricked me, Mr. Krabs.

I wouldn't have collected
all those jellyfish

had I known that
this was their fate.

This isn't right!

Jellyfish need wide,
open space and fresh air.

Easy, boy, what are you doin'
with that?

Something that should
have been done a long time ago.

No!

The squeaky bolt on this door
was driving me crazy.

Whew.

And now, I'm going

to set these jellyfish free!

[ struggling]

[ chortling]

Well, you can'tthe door
is voiceactivated

and it will only open
if I say "open."

[ electronic beeping]

Freedom...

Freedom!

You'll never catch me!

[ laughing]

What?

Blasted exercise craze.

[ screaming]

Goodbye, friends.

I'm taking jelly off the menu.

He really got burned
on that deal.

[ laughs]

All is as it should be.

I promise never to use this net

for anything
but pure sport again.

Jellyfish aren't meant to be
captured forever.

Oh, Noname...

I guess I can name you now.

I'll call you... Friend.

[ electricity crackling]

[ titters]

[ crowd cheering]

ANNOUNCER:
Welcome, sports fans

to the 12th Annual Bikini Bottom
Fry Cook Games!

[ playing fanfare]

[ trumpets playing 
triumphant song]

[ crowd cheering]

I declare these
Fry Cook Games

open!

[ emergency tone whistling]

[ playing fanfare]

[ panting]

I declare these
Fry Cook Games...

open!

[ crowd gasps]

ANNOUNCER:
So begin the 21st
Fry Cook Games.

I'm a realistic fish head
and it's a beautiful day

here at Bikini Bottom's
Fast Food Coliseum.

They come from everywhere
microwaves hum...

patties sizzle...

and heat lamps keep the fast
food spirit warm and soggy.

But the real story
is the bitter rivalry

between former competitors
Mr. Krabs of The Krusty Krab

and Plankton, of the Chumbucket.

Who could forget the year
Mr. Krabs won gold

for this 500pickle
clean and jerk?

[ grunts]

Not Plankton.

Or when Plankton
won the hearts of millions

by performing this perfect
onion ring routine

with a broken antenna?

[ straining]

Krabs wasn't moved.

And now, late word is
that this year

the Krusty Krab
will be represented

by a new competitor,
on what is perhaps

the greatest day
of his young life.

This is perhaps
the greatest day

of my young life,
Mr. Krabs.

[ panting]

I can't believe
I'm representing

the Krusty Krab in
the Fry Cook Games!

To bring home
the gold

is to bring
honor and glory

to the Krusty Krab.

And all that free publicity
will bring in customers!

So don't lose!

Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!

[ straining]:
KrustyKrab.

KrustyKrab.

KrustyKrab.

KrustyKrab...Hey, SpongeBob.

Hi, Patrick.

KrustyKrab.

KrustyKrab.

KrustyKrab.

[ grunting]

Are you trying
to move the ground?

You'll never move it
like that.

You got to get
under... neath it!

Come on, Patrick

I'm trying to train
for the Games.

Games?
Can I play?

Ah, sorry, Patrick,
you have to be a fry cook.

Be a fry cook?

Is that all
I gotta do?

That'll be easy!

What do you mean,
"easy"?

How hard can it be?

They don't let
just anybody

be a fry cook.

We're an elite corps.

Oh, come on

you're just
flipping patties.

Hey, flipping is not
as easy as it sounds.

[ hissing]

Why don't you go home,
Patrick?

You can compete in the Laying
UnderARockAllDay Games!

[ gasping]:
At least I don't polish
my fingernails!

[ gasping]:
You take that back!

Fingernails,
fingernails,
fingernails!

You don't even have
fingernails.

I cannot believe
what I am hearing!

How can you hear it?!

You don't have ears,
either!

You...

Holes, holes!

Conehead!

Yellow!

Pink!

Oh!

I'm going to get
a job as a fry cook

and it'll be easy!

Fine!

[ grunting]

KrustyKrab!

KrustyKrab!

KrustyKrab...

[ sniffing]

What's that smell
in the air?

I smell Plankton!

Oh, yeah?

Well, I smell...

[ sniffing loudly]

Pew, he's right.

[ show music begins]

[ toots horn offkey]

I love messing things up.

Are you ready
to do or die, Krabs?

Always ready, Plankton,
always ready.

Good, because today, the
Chumbucket is going to kick...

your carapace!

That's what you think.

But I got me
a champion

SpongeBob!

Show him.

[ making karate screams]

[ giggles]

Look at him...

in his prime.

You ain't got no chance!

That's where you're wrong, Krabs

for I, too, have a champion.

Ladies and gentlemen,
turn your attention

to the southwest corridor.

Other way.

[ softly]:
Imbeciles.

And... stop!

Perfect!

Representing the Chumbucket

a creature so fearsome,
so terrible

so mindbendingly large

that those of you
with weak constitutions

may want to leave the stadium.

I gotta get out of here!

PLANKTON:
Too late!

Ready or not, here he comes.

Quake with fear,
you mortal fools.

Bow down before
the awesome might of...

[ crashing]

this huge guy who's carrying
the real contestant...

Patrick Star!

Patrick, what are
you doing here?

You're not
a fry cook.

Oh, yes, I am,
Mr. SpongeBob
Superior Pants.

Check it out!

I been working
for the Chumbucket

for almost
five minutes!

Well, it doesn't
matter anyway

'cause you're going
to eat my dust.

Uhuh, I'm eating
my own dust.

Not if I eat it first!

Yellow!Pink!

I can't believe it,
Mr. Krabs.

I thought Patrick
was my friend.

Friend?

Not in here he ain't.

What do you mean?

He's not really
your friend.

He's not?

He's plotting your downfall
right now!

He is?

He's going to stab you

in the back!

He wouldn't!

Of course
he would.

Just look at him.

Square...

the shape of evil!

KRABS:
It's a mockery
of your profession.

Are we going to let
some pretender

take away what
belongs to the Krusty Krab?!

No!

Then get mean!

I'm mean!

Get angry!

I'm angry!

Now get out there...

And win...

That...

Medal!

[ bellowing]

[ growling]

[ both growling]

[ growls weakly]

ANNOUNCER:
Our first event:
the deepfry pole vault!

Win this one
for the Krusty Krab!

For the Krusty Krab!

[ crowd saying "Oh"]

[ crowd saying "Yay"]

Win this one because
I told you to.

Because you told me to!

[ grunting]

[ cheering]

Fish sticks!

Get your
fish sticks here!

ANNOUNCER:
The next event:
the chocolate highdive.

Make way for
the real fry cook,
Patrick.

ANNOUNCER:
For his dive, SpongeBob
will be attempting

a full banana fudgepop
with two sticks.

And now, absolute silence.

I scream...

for ice cream!

ANNOUNCER:
Perfect entry!

And toasted almonds
that's unexpected.

He stuck it!

And just look
at that even coating!

Top that...

Pinky.

Almonds?

Curse him,
that's good...

but perhaps a bit
too highbrow

for this crowd.

He thinks he's
better than them!

[ grunts]

Better than you!

[ grunts more forcefully]

Now get up there
and show him

how the common man

prepares his frozen
dairy treats!

[ bellowing]

ANNOUNCER:
Patrick will be resurrecting
an old favorite:

the singlescoop strawberry cone
with a chocolate dip.

Just look at that concentration!

Oh, a little shaky
on that entry

but just look at that form!

Take that, Yellow Boy!

Laugh while you can,
Pinky.

It's not over yet.

That's what you think

but it's not over yet!

It's not over yet!

With the score tied
we go to our final event:

Bun Wrestling.

Who will take home
the gold?

Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?

Don't forget,
he called ye yellow.

ANNOUNCER:
Or Plankton, of the Chumbucket?

Don't forget,
he called you pink!

No!

My name's not "Rick"!

[ shouting and grunting]

I don't like you.

I don't like you more!

I never liked you!

I a thousand times
never liked you!

Pink!

Yellow!

[ straining]

[ ripping]

[ crowd gasping]

SPONGEBOB:
[ gasps] Yellow!

PATRICK:
Pink?

[ together]:
You do care.

[ sobbing]

Let's promise never
to fight again,
buddy.

Yeah, pal,
let's go home.

[ both whistling]

[ crowd booing]

Hey, where you going?

Get back here
and kill each other!

You're my
best friend ever.

You, too, Patrick.

You know, these were white
when I bought them.

MR. KRABS:
Counting my money

Money sweeter than honey

Money, money this,
money, money that

Profit will make
me wallet fat.

What?! Profits down
three dollars from last month!

I got to start running
a tighter ship around here!

Thank you for choosing
the Krusty Krab.

Here's your change.

Mr. Squidward!

What?

What's with all this
change nonsense?

Over and under,
grab the end

put it through here

up and around, round the horn,
bring it back home.

Hmm?

Spongebob, I ain't
paying you

to play dress up.

[ inhaling]

Breathe on
your own time.

I don't pay
you to breathe.

You hardly pay us at all.

Oh, that reminds me.

I got something for you.

Ah, yes, our meager restitution.

Ah, the sweet smell of payday.

Huh?

Oh, sorry, that's
me dry cleaning.

Here's your check.

And here's yours,
Spongebob.

I can't accept
your money, Mr. Krabs.

Grilling is my passion.

What is this?!

You're making me pay you
to stand at the cash register?

What is the meaning
of this?

Have you gone off
the deep end?

There's going to be a few
changes around here.

Every time I catch
you two goofing off

I'm going to charge you for it.

18, 19... and 20.

Here you go, Mr. K.

I think this should
cover all my nonsense.

Oh, and here's
an extra

50 cents for when
I was tying my shoe.

[ panting]

Uh, Spongebob...

what do you think
you're doing?

I'm just giving
Mr. Krabs the money
I owe him.

Well, I am not paying that
cheapskate Krab one cent.

And I suggest

you do the same.

Why?

We've got to unite
as workers

and demand the respect
we deserve from the boss.

In fact, you and I
should go on strike.

Wow! You and me
go on strike?

Sure.

After all, you like
your job, right?

Right.

And you want to keep
working here, right?

Right.

And while you work here

you expect to be
treated fairly, right?

Right.

Then let's go on strike!

Yay! A strike!

Going on strike

We're going on strike

I still don't know
what strike means.

But we're going on a strike.

Hey, guess what,
Mr. Krabs

me and Squidward are
going to go on strike.

A strike?
Yeah.

You mean you're going
to make picket signs?
Yeah.

And you're going to make
protest speeches?
Yeah, yeah.

And you're going
to demand me respect?

Yeah!

[ sobbing]:
No.

No!

Squidward!

You didn't tell me
I was going to get fired!

Without The Krusty Krab, II...

[ sobbing]:
Oh, Squidward,
could you hold me?

I think I'm going
to be sick.

Spongebob...

News flash, Spongebob:
I got fired, too.

This is exactly why
we need to go on strike.

He can't treat us
like this anymore.

He owes us for all the precious,
irretrievable moments

we've wasted in this trash heap.

Soon he'll realize he needs us
more than we need him.

We are workers united!

[ clears throat]

Sorry.

Just do exactly
as I say, Spongebob

and in no time you will
have your job back

and more.

And more?

All right, Spongebob,
now listen up.

I'm going to have to
teach you how to strike.

First, we must get rid
of our uniforms.

They are a symbol
of our oppression.

I want you to throw your hat
on the ground like so.

Now, stomp it into the dust.

Your turn, Spongebob.

That's the idea.

Now, throw it on the ground.

[ grunts]

[ grunting]

[ cries]

I can't do it, Squidward.

This hat is my friend;
it never oppressed me.

Spongebob,
you're pathetic.

Look, I threw my hat
on the ground.

Aha, a confession.

Next time think
before you litter.

Okay, pay attention, Spongebob.

Now we're going to
make picket signs.

This is a very important
part of striking.

Like this, Squidward.

Not a picket fence,
you dingdong.

Picket sign!

How's this?

[ flat]:
No.

This is a picket sign.

"Krusty Krab Unfair."
Short, sweet and to the point.

How about this, Squidward?

Spongebob, it's
unfair, not funfair.

A funfair? Where?

Oh, I could go
for some fun.

At The Krusty Krab.

Hey, everybody, let's
go to the funfair.

[ crowd yelling]

Krusty Krab is unfair!

Mr. Krabs is in there!

Standing at the concession!

Plotting his oppression!

What the heck
does that mean?

I don't know.

Squidward told me
to yell it at people.

Then, you must be
Spongebob Squarepants.

Yes.

Dude, you are like
a fry cook legend.

Will you sign my spatula?

Anything for an
aspiring fry cook.

So, did you come down
to help out the cause?

No. I came to take your job.

Hey, thanks, dude!

Attention, Spongebob!

You are a terrible striker!

You just let your replacement
cross our picket line

without so much as
a single threat.

I'm sorry, Squidward.

How about I try
the signs again?

FORGET THE SIGNS!

I've got something
for you to do.

Go stand over there.

Like this, Squidward?

Almost.

A little more
to the right.

And... perfect.

Attention,
people of Bikini Bottom!

You have been cheated
and lied to!

I knew it.

The gentle laborer
shall no longer suffer

from the noxious greed
of Mr. Krabs!

Hey, what's that guy
talking about?

I don't know but
he's got a megaphone.

We will dismantle oppression
board by board!

We'll saw the foundation
of big business in half!

Even if it takes an eternity!

Gee, I don't know what
Squidward's talking about

but he sure sounds convincing.

With your support we will send
the hammer of the people's will

crashing through
the windows

of Mr. Krabs'
house of servitude!

[ thunderous cheering]

Wow.

All this supporting
is making me hungry.

Hey, everybody, let's
go get a Krabby Patty.

[ cheering]

Nobody gives a care
about the fate of labor

as long as they can get
their instant gratification.

That was a great
speech, Squidward.

You practically had them
eating out of your hands.

But they didn't, did
they, Mr. Squidward?

'Cause they were too busy
eating out of mine.

I wish you two had
gone on strike earlier.

Thanks for attracting
all these paying customers

with all your signage
and your sloganeering.

All right, Mr. Krabs.

You've gone
too far this time.

You can pick on me,
but Squidward is a great leader.

We are workers united!

We're tired of your smelly greed

and we're going to saw
all your tables

and we're going to smash stuff
with the people's hammer.

And we're going to...

we're going to...

Squidward, what was
that other part?

Dismantle your oppressive
establishment?

Yeah, that, too!

And me and Squidward
are going to stay on strike

until we get
what we deserve!

Even if it takes...

forever!

Forever!

Forever!

Forever!

Forever!

On strike with Spongebob

forever?

Hey, Squidward

I bet old man Krabs is
going to break any day.

Eh, Squidward?

Eh, Squidward?

Eh, Squidward?

Eh, Squidward?

Eh, Squidward?

Eh, Squidward?

Aah!

I got to beg Mr. Krabs
for my job back

and put an end
to this nightmare!

[ yells]
Oh.

uh...

Evening, Mr. Squidward, uh...

I was just in the neighborhood
and, I, uh...

thought I'd drop by to...

beg you to come back to work.

The Krusty Krab
is a wreck!

I'm ruined without you
and the little yellow guy.

The teenagers I hired
is ruining the place.

And the worst part is

they won't leave me alone.

All right, Mr. Krabs.

See what I mean?

Squidward, please,
you got to come back.

You'll give us 
anythingwe want?

Yes. Anything.

So what do you say,
Mr. Squidward?

Your story breaks
my heart, Mr. Krabs.

Why don't we take
a little walk and, uh...

discuss my terms.

I got a bad feeling in
the pit of me wallet.

Hey, Mean Mr. Boss Man

I'ma quitting
this here job...

Gee, being on strike with
Squidward sure is a kick.

Squidward's words are still
buzzing around in my head

like an angry jellyfish.

Squidward was right.

I can't just sit here,
it's time for action.

I will restore the working man
to his rightful glory.

I will dismantle this
oppressive establishment

board by board.

I will saw the tables
of tyranny in half.

Gnaw at the ankles
of big business.

Squidward will be so proud.

Well, Squidward

those were intense
negotiations.

I'm glad you saw it
our way, Mr. Krabs.

Now I can fire
them teenagers

and get me two
golden boys back.

[ gasps]:
Ah!

Well, see you at work.

[ humming]

[ stuttering]:
SpSpSpongebob.

WhWhWhat have
you done?

I did exactly as
you said, Squidward.

I dismantled the
establishment.

Now we'll get our
jobs back for sure.

[ humming]

Squidward!

Spongebob!

Yes, Mr. Krabs?Yes, Mr. Krabs?

Here it comes.

In order to pay off
these damages

you two are going
to work for me

forever!

Yahoo!

The strike worked,
Squidward.

We got our jobs
back. Forever.

Forever.

Forever.

Forever.

Ah, another peaceful evening 
in Bikini Bottom.

Listen to 
the tropical tranquillity.

[ rumbling]

Wha?

[ crash]

[ glass shattering]

SPONGEBOB: 
I saw it.

It was big.

It was all wiggly.

And it ate everything.

That's horrible.

[ gulps]

It was an

Alaskan

bull worm!

[ loud murmuring]

He ate my wheelbarrow.

He ate my children's homework.

Do I need to say it?

How can we protect ourselves?

I got it!

Let's all buy a Krabby Patty.

ALL:
Boo!

We should lock our doors.

We should call my nephew.

We should
dig a moat.

We should dig Bikini Bottom
and push it somewhere else.

[ silence]

That idea may just be
crazy enough...

to get us all killed.

[ heated shouts]

Let's get someone
to go after it.

There ain't no one
fool enough to take on
an Alaskan bull worm.

[ metallic scraping]

You got a bathroom
in this place?

In the back.

Thanks.

I'll catch your worm for you.

That is, if'n
you're willing to pay.

MR. KRABS:
No!

You'll never get
a cent out of me.

Never!

I'd rather that worm come
in here right now

and eat you all alive.

[ panting]

[ sighs]

Sorry.

[ chuckles]

Aw, shucks.
I don't want your money.

I was just playing up
the drama of the moment, is all.

[ nonchalant laughter]

[ weeping sobs]

Nope, I'm gonna take
that spineless critter down
for nothing

'cause this is personal.

Look, my tail's gone.

[ gasping]

Varmint must have got it

while I had my back turned,
the coward!

[ groaning]

I am going to get back
what's mine.

Yeah!

What?

But Sandy, you don't know
what you're up against.

We're talking about

an Alaskan

bull worm.

Well, I don't know
nothing about Alaska

but lookee here.

Back in Texas, I wrangled bulls

and I wrangled worms.

Far as I'm concerned

doing them both together
just saves rope.

Now, I'm going to go kick me
some worm tail.

Yeehaw!

But Sandy,
you don't know.

Don't worry, Spongebob.
I won't be long.

Sandy...

Sandy!

Go get him, Sandy.

We have the utmost
confidence in you.

Now, what was
that idea of yours?

PATRICK:
Push!

[ groaning]

[ Spongebob panting]

Wait!

Sandy!

Hey, Spongebob

you coming to watch?

Sandy!

Don't go!

Why not?

Sandy, I saw it.

It's big, scary and pink.

So's Patrick's bellybutton

but I ain't afraid of that,
neither.

You'll get massacred.

Spongebob, I'm
from Texas.

What you think is big,
and what I think is big

are two totally different bigs.

Besides, he's got my tail.
I can't take that sitting down.

Okay, but what if the worm
didn't take your tail?

If that worm ain't got my tail,
who does?

Um... I do.

You do? Where?

Uh, in my... pocket.

[ giggles]:
Well, why didn't you
just say so?

Give it here.

Come on.

[ creaking]

Oh!

[ rattling]

Spongebob, that's a
paper clip and a
piece of string.

No, it's not.
This is your tail.

Spongebob!

How would you know?
It's always behind you.

Oh, don't go, don't go

[ voice breaking]:
don't go...

Spongebob, what is
the matter with you?

Now, I'm going
to go give

that legless rascal
what for.

And there ain't nothing

you can say to stop me.

Oh, yeah?

What if I said

"Blargin fedibble
nohip?"

Well, I got to admit,
that slowed me down.

But I'm still
going for him.

You know, tails
are so overrated.

Let's just forget
about it and go home.

I've got ice cream.

With nuts.

Sandy, this is your
pappy speaking

and I forbid you to
go after this worm.

Y'all come back
here, young lady.

You ain't my pa.

Sandy, if you want
to get to that worm

you're going to have to go
through me.

[ creaks]

Sandy, no, I
can't let you.

I'm not going to
let you get killed.

If you find him, you'll
get eaten for sure.

Ain't no way
some dumb, old sea worm's

going to make a meal of me.

I'm too Texas tough.

[ sobs]:
No...

Not tough enough.
Not tough enough.

Spongebob, quit your worrying.

I can take care
of myself.

After all, who's the strongest
critter in Bikini Bottom?

[ horn blows]

You are.

And who put the

"hiyahihok"

in karate?

Youdid.

And who saves
your yellow backside

from certain destruction
on a regular basis?

[ meekly]:
You do.

Right, and I can handle
your little bull worm, too

'cause Iam the best
there is.

There ain't nothing
too big

or too ornery
for me to catch.

Okay.

Say it.

There isn't anything...

Ain't nothing...

Ain't nothingtoo big

or too ornery
for you to catch.

But...Ah!

But...Ah!

And...Oh!

We...Oh!

I...No!

Yeah, but...No.

You see...No!

I...Oh!

[ sniffs]

Worm sign.

He's in that cave.

Sandy, are you sure you...?

Course, I am.
I'm going in

and I ain't coming out

till I got me a big, heaping
plate of worm stew.

[ cries]

Aha!

There you are,
you tailnabbin' varmint.

Hiya!

[ crushing blows]

I'm winning,
Spongebob.

Sandy, that's not...

[ crushing blows]

Hiya, hiya!

This shouldn't
take long.

Sandy, that's not...

[ crushing blows]

[ Sandy cries out]

Almost done.

Sandy!

[ crushing blows and shouts]

Yeehaw!
I got him, Spongebob.

Sandy?

Boy, howdy!

This critter put up
some sort of fight.

But I'm from Texas,
and as you can see

no worm is a match for me.

I even found my tail.

That's not the worm.

Pardon?

That's not the worm.

That's his tongue.

[ voice breaking]:
Oh...

this is the tongue.

And the whole thing
is the worm.

Run for your life!

[ growls and roars]

[ panting]

So, what's
the plan, Sandy?

Run faster!

I could have thought of that.

Hey, wait a minute.

I was right, wasn't I?

Later.

Aw, he is too big for you,
isn't he?

Not now,
Spongebob.

I want to hear you say it.

Can we talk some other time?

Say it.

Spongebob?

Say it, or I'll trip you.

No. Get away.

Say it.Not now.

Say it.Okay.

You were right, and I was wrong.

I was wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong.

Are you happy now?

I knew it.

[ growls]

[ screaming]

[ panting]

[ growling]

Not again.

Uh, Sandy?

Yeah?

What do we do now?

[ panting]

[ roars]

I've got it!
Spongebob, you still got

that paper clip and that string?

I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.

Look, it's a necklace.

"S" for "Spongebob"
or "S" for "Sandy."

That way they can identify
our bodies.

No, silly, how about "S"

for "Save our skins"?

Yeehaw!

Now, thisis what
I call a rodeo.

We'll be nice
and safe up here.

[ train whistle blowing]

[ screaming]

[ panting]

We did it!

Yay!

He'll never get
out of there.

We saved the town.

Yay, let's go
tell everybody.

So...

it was just another failed
Krabby Patty theft attempt

by my archcompetitor,
Plankton.

[ deep laughter]

For a second there,
I mistook you for a threat

but you're just
a dirty, little man.

So long, shrimp!

[ crash]

Curse you, Mr. Krabs!

[ clunk]

Ouch!

[ yawns]

So, typical day of failure,
I see, huh, darling?

Oh, can it, computer wife.

Can't you see I'm exhausted?

Why don't you go
make yourself useful

and synthesize me up some grub?

Yes, Your Majesty.

What do we got here?

Oh, goodie!

Holographic meatloaf again.

When am I going to get

Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food.

Just look at his daughter.

She's as big as a whale.

I wish I could be successful

I wish I could somehow

Two deluxe
Krabby Patties.

There you are, sir.

Two deluxe...

Ahoy, there,
Mr. Plankton.

Er, uh, hey, there,
uh, Spongebob.

Uh, Spongebob...

Yes, sir?

I'm going to need
to take one of these patties

back to my office
for, uh... bun inspection.

I'm afraid you
can't do that

Mr. Plankton.

But why not?

Because that patty is
for the customer, sir.

The customer?

I'll boil the customer
in hot oil

and I'll rip out his...!

I mean, yes, of course,
for the lovely customer.

But you can
take these
patties, sir.

I made them
on the off chance

you decided to instigate

some bun inspection
today, Mr. Plankton, sir.

Uh, yes.
Uh, very nice.

Um, thanks.

[ fast pattering feet]

[ slams]

All mine!

It's finally all mine!

The patties...

the wealth...

the notoriety...

the... Spongebob?

What do you want?

Well, it's just that
it's Tuesday again, sir

and I was wondering
if I could have my...

uh... my, uh...

weekly performance review.

Review?

Oh, yes,
please, sir, please!

But I've never reviewed 
anything...

except for those foreign
exercise videos

my cousin sent me.

Oh, please, sir!

I want to make you
so happy and proud!

Ah, you're doing fine.

Now leave me to my work.

Mmm...

But sir...

I thought I sent
you away, Cretan!

But sir, there's got to be
something I need to improve on.

Anything!

All right, the sauce.

[ gasps]

Wh...what?

The sauce, I don't know.

You're using
too much sauce, okay?

Review's over.

[ stammering]

What?

[ stammering]

What's the matter with you?

All I said was
a little too much sauce.

It's no big deal, really.

[ whimpering]

What do you want from me,
a promotion?

A pro... a promot...
a promotion?!

Uh, sure, kid,
you're, uh...

you're on register now.

[ gasps]

Register?

Glad that's over.

[ kissing]

Spongebob, do you remember
that little talk we had

about personal space?

It's okay, Squidward,
I'm official. Look!

Cocashier?!

So, have you two
known each other long?

[ loud clang]

You can't do this to me,
Mr. Plankton!

If you think I'm going
to stand out there all day

listening to...

[ jabbering]

...then you must have coral
wedged in your frontal lobe!

So what do you want me to do
about it?

I'd like my view
to be a little less yellow

if you know what I mean.

[ sizzling]

Hope you like gray.

Hey, Squidward, I can see you
through this little window.

[ grunts]

Now, no more intrusions.

I'd like to begin writing
the memoirs of my success story.

So everyone just stay the...

Daddy!

Daddy! Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

Just tell Daddy
what you want!

Daddy!

He's very busy!

Could I please have a, um...

What? It's just
an ordinary Krabby...

Oh, my goodness!

Squidward!

SPONGEBOB:
I tried,
Mr. Plankton.

I really did.

Oh, what now?

A customer ordered
a medium soda

and I gave him a large.

I gave him a large!

I've soiled
the good Krusty Krab name!

[ repeating]:
Soiled it! Soiled it...!

I command you to stop that.

Stop that, and return
to your post!

Soiled it!
Soiled it...!

Where's the off button
on this thing?

Okay, Daddy, I've decided
I'm going to run away.

Run away and find
a newdaddy!

Make it stop!

[ alarm blaring]

What, did I say the secret word?

No, sir.

He's back.

Who's back? What?[ whoosh]

What was that?!

Man your stations!
Red alert! Red alert!

Take cover!

[ all yelling]

Take cover from what?!

He's around here somewhere.

There he goes!

What? Who? Where?

Somebody tell me!

Some say he crawled out

from the lowest trench
in the ocean.

He's the saltiest
of all of the sea dogs.

He's the most hated creature
in Bikini Bottom.

And he's finally got
a Krabby Patty!

[ sinister laughter]

Krabs?! What the barnacle
is going on here?!

It's your archcompetitor
Krabs!

His goal in life
is to steal a Krabby Patty

and ruin our restaurant.

That's terrible!

Yeah! But the worst part
of it is...

[ pounding]

Good grief,
he's naked!

[ sinister laughter]

You did it, Mr. Plankton.

You said it, pal.

Can you believe that sun?

I could look at it all day.

Uh, Patrick?

What?

Nothing.

So, how's that
tan coming?

I don't know.

Let me check.

Looking good.

How's yours?

Just a minute.

[ yells]

I could have sworn
I was laying on my back.

Larry! Larry!

Larry! Larry!

Hey, it's Larry,
the lifeguard.

Mr. Lifeguard,
can I feel
your muscle?

Sure. Don't scratch
the paint.

Lifeguard, how's
the tubage?

Gnarly, dudes.

All right, yeah!
Whoohoo!

Lifeguard, can
you point out
the snack bar?

Right over there.

But you guys
are way too old

and unsightly
for my beach.

And I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

So polite.

Just like we raised him.

What a guy.

Is it any wonder
he's so popular?

Just imagine
if Iwere a lifeguard.

[ dramatic music plays]

That would be so cool.

Oh, what do you want
to be a lifeguard for?

Nobody really likes those guys.

For he's a jolly,
good fellow...

Being a lifeguard is so dumb.

All they do is blow, blow,
blow on their stupid whistles

rub, rub, rub that white stuff
on their noses

and show off their gross

misshapen bodies.

Dude, put that
thing away.

There are, like,
children here.

[ squishing]

I'm going to the snack bar.

Who needs to be a lifeguard?

I'm cool.

I'm every bit as cool as Larry.

And if I'm not,
let me be struck by...

[ thunder crashes]

a flying ice cream truck...

[ ice cream truck music plays]

...and live!

[ tires screech]

Please, do not land

flying ice cream trucks
on the bathers.

Oh...

Spongebob, you okay?

Hey!

I didn't know
you were a lifeguard.

Lifeguard?

The nose.

[ gasps]

White stuff.

You think I'm a lifeguard?

Sure, there's no hiding
the lifeguard look, Spongebob

and you've got it.

You really think so?

You bet, I do.

Say, we're a little
shorthanded around here.

How would you like
to work the beach?

[ highpitched voice]:
I'd love it!

All right.

Leave that
on the bench, Kahuna.

Hey, Annette, come here.

I want you to meet
my buddy, Spongebob.

Hi.

Hey, guy's a lifeguard.

[ whistles]

[ crowd cheers]

It works.

Whoohoo!

That was the
greatest, Larry.

Yeah.

Say, how'd you like to take
the second shift?

By myself?

Only if you think
you're ready.

I'm not just ready.

I'm Ready Freddie.

It's Larry.

Well, I guess I'll just...

Help! Help!

Help!

Help! help!

We've got a sinker.

Spongebob, let me take this.

I haven't seen
any action all day.

Action?

[ grunting]

[ yells]

[ panting]

Please, help.
Please, help.

[ moaning]

[ gasping]

[ cheering]

Breathe, darn you!

[ grunting]

[ chokes]

That's the last time
I read and swim.

You saved my life.

Don't mention it.
It's all part of the job.

You know, Spongebob,
the babes

and the big chair
are great

but the best part is knowing
you're the only thing

that stands between
these good people...

Go, go, go, go, go...

...and a watery grave.

And that's
what it's all about.

Their lives are
in your hands now

'cause I got a date
with a tanning booth.

See you.

[ tires screech]

But I...

can't swim.

Oh, if I'd known
being a lifeguard meant

guarding their lives,
I would never have said yes.

Maybe nothing will go wrong.

Then when Larry comes back

I'll tell him
I'm not interested.

Besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

[ bell tolls]

[ screams]

[ frantic yelling]

Emergency!
Everybody out of the water.

Hurry! Emergency!
Out of the water.

Emergency!

What's going on,
lifeguard?

What's the big emergency?

Uh... there are
sharks in there.

Hey, that's my family
you're talking about.

A... sea monster!

[ stomping]

You know, we sea monsters
have made great strides

in the fields of science
and literature.

Uh... somebody went?

It's a big lagoon,
dude.

Disgusting!

No, don't go!

[ laughing]

[ yells]

[ shrieks]

[ screams]

[ laughs]

[ groans]

[ laughs]

[ groans]

[ laughs]

Free ice cream!

[ cheering]

Plenty for
everybody.

One for you,
one for you...

Okay, everybody got one?

Mmm, yeah!

Mmm...

[ slurping]

Aha, now I got you.

Now, you all have to wait
one hour before you go swimming.

[ murmuring]

But just so you're not tempted.

[ anxious laughter]

[ muttering]

Ladies and gentlemen

the lagoon is closed.

We like Larry better.

Does Larry ever give you
free ice cream?

Ice cream!

Did somebody say, "ice cream?"

Where is it?

Is it here?

Huh?

Ice cream! Yay!

[ laughs]

Cramp!

[ moans]

Oh!

[ treading water]

Holy cow!

Somebody's drowning!

Oh, no, that's not possible.

The lagoon is closed.

Dude, get your butt
in the water.

If there was anyone in there,
we'd hear them.

Help, help!

[ treading water]:
I can't swim!

Somebody would be screaming
that they're drowning...

I'm drowning!
I'm drowning!

[ treading water]

They would have to have
crossed the line.

I'm drowning
'cause I crossed the line.

Okay, I'll take a look...

but just to prove to you that...
Patrick isn't drowning!

Can't swim!

Butt hurts.

Ice cream.

Hold on, Patrick.

I'm coming.

[ panting]

Help, help!

Don't move.

Catch this.

[ moans]

Quit fooling around, man.
Get in the water.

Help, help!

Oh, what am I going to do?
Got to think.

Got to think.
Got to run around and think.

Got to run around
and think at the same time.

Got to think,
got to have a plan.

Got to think, think, think.
I've got it!

Patrick can't drown
if there isn't any water.

[ gurgling]:
Well, you're safe now, Patrick.

Help, I'm drowning,
I've got butt cramps

I want ice cream
and now it's dark.

[ sobbing and treading water]

Help, help!
Help me, I'm drowning.

Help.

To us.

Oh!

Sorry.
Here's your hot dog.

Okay, Patrick,
here I come.

Oh.

Come, come 'round Pat.

Here I am.

Pat, Pat, no.
Uncle, hold it,
Pat, Pat, stop.

No, Pat, stop.

Stop, stop!

Oh. Sorry.

[ treading water]

Help! Help!

[ nervous mumbling]

Save me, can't swim.

Patrick, don't.

Help.

Help, help, help...

Help!

Help us.
We're drowning!

[ whistling and murmuring]

I wonder what's showing

at the movie theater
right about now.

Goodbye, Patrick.

Goodbye, ice cream.

Help, can't swim.Help, can't swim.

Oh, no.Oh, no.

Spongebob?

Yes, Larry?

You're not a lifeguard, are you?

No, Larry.

Let's go, guys.

[ panting]

Very good.

You fellows are

[ panting]

Ow!

Butt cramps!Butt cramps!

And I still don't
have my ice cream.

A big boy's
got to eat.

Well, you can't have any.

And do you know why,
Spongebob?

Because your club president
is a shell.

If you had listened to me

you'd have food, shelter
and a roaring fire

but instead you listened
to a talking clam

that tells you nothing.

'Cause the answers
to all your problems

will fall right out of the sky.

[ laughing]

Fall right out
of the sky.

Dude, we're falling
right out of the sky!

We got to drop
the load!

[ beeps]

BOTH:
Praise the magic conch!

Mm, mm.

[ both laugh]

Hey, Spongebob,
that sure is

a lot of food
you got there.

It's a gift
from the magic conch.

Everything sure
looks delicious.

Ooh, smoked sausages,
my favorite.

Uh, hey, Spongebob

you know I was just
kidding around earlier.

I mean, I'm still part
of the club, right?

And after all, the club
got to stick together.

I mean, you know...

Squidward.

Yes?

Once a member, always a member.

BOTH:
To the club!

[ blubbering]

Yeah.

[ blubbers weakly]

Now, if you'll excuse me.

What shall I eat first

the spaghetti, the turkey,
the soup, the canned meat?

Why don't you ask
the magic conch, Squidward?

Oh, yeah, like that'll happen.

Right after I consult
the magic toenail.

Squidward,
are you questioning

the authority
of the magic conch?

The conch is the one
who gave us this banquet.

This copyrighted conch
is the cornerstone

of our organization.

Maybe he's not a brother.

You guys have it
all wrong.

I love this piece
of plastic.

Hello, there.

Magic conch, I was wondering

should I have the spaghetti
or the turkey?

Neither.

Oh. Then how about the soup?

I don't think so.

Can I have anything to eat?

No.

No? What do you mean no?

I'm starving here!

Here, let me try.

Magic conch, could Squidward
have some of this

yummy, delicious,
superterrific sandwich?

No.

Hmm. Could I have this

yummy, delicious,
super terrific sandwich?

Yes.

All right!

[ whirring sound]

[ belches]

Sorry, Squidward.

Give me that!

Could I have something to eat?

No.

Could I have something to eat?

No.

Could I have something to eat?

No.

Can't you say anything else
but no?

Try asking again.

Can I have something to eat?

No.

[ grunting in frustration]

Squidward, are you all right?

Maybe we should ask
the shell if he's okay.

Hello, anyone there?
Hello? Hello?

Do you folks need some help?

I'm saved!

You don't know how happy
I am to see you.

I've been stranded
out here for weeks

with these two
barnacleheads

and their magic
conch shell.

Magic conch shell?

You mean like this?!

BOTH:
Magic conch! A club member!

My conch told me
to come save you guys.

ALL:
Hooray for the magic conches!

All right, magic conch,
what do we do now?

Nothing.

All hail the magic conch!

All hail the magic conch!

NARRATOR: 
Ah... springtime 
in Bikini Bottom.

All sea creatures

have an innate sense 
of the seasonal changes.

Like the starfish.

A quick survey 
of his environment

and he knows that...

It's spring!

The starfish then sheds 
his winter coat

and stores it away 
safe for winter.

[ sniffs]

I better call the doctor

'cause I've got spring fever!

Good morning, little flowers.

[ sighs]

Good morning, Squidward.

Isn't it a lovely day?

Huh.

Did you say hello
to the flowers yet?

Good morning, flowers.

[ hissing]

[ screams]

Gosh, I didn't know Squidward
had hay fever.

I'll do him a kindness

and planet
some hypoallergenic flowers.

You're on your way.

I bet you're thirsty.

[ gasps]

[ grunts]

I'm not taking my eyes off you.

[ sighs]

Hey, Spongebob.

Hi, Patrick.

How does this keep happening?

[ crunching]

Hi.

[ neighs]

[ neighs]

She's beautiful.

[ neighs]

Wow...

What a magnificent sea horse.

I shall tame her.

Who knows
what we can accomplish!

"Because of her
mysterious behavior

I have decided
to name her Mystery."

Hmm, now that I think about it

she's also very graceful
and majestic.

Perhaps I should name her
Grace or Majesty

or Debbie.

[ neighs]

She must have spotted
my floral bookmark.

She's coming this way.

That's a girl.

Don't be afraid.

I'm just a talking sponge
is all.

[ sniffs]

[ giggling]

[ huffing and puffing]

[ neighs]

[ nickers]

[ laughing]

Gosh, Mystery

that was the greatest day
of my life.

Do you think
we'll be friends forever?

[ snoring]

I'll take that as a "yes."

[ horse neighing]

What the...?

Hey, Squidward, still riding
to work on the machine I see.

Don't say anything, Squidward.

Remember your karma.

[ grunting and groaning]

[ moans]

[ neighing]

Whoa, girl.

Now, you wait out here
until I'm done with work.

See you at the
end of my shift.

Hey, look, Mr. Krabs
put in a kiddy ride.

Why don't you
try it out?

I can't find
the coin slot.

Here it is.

[ neighing loudly]

[ punching]

[ yelling]

Yeeah! Help!

Kiddie ride
on the loose!

What's with all the ruckus?

A monster...

scaring away
me customers.

That's not a monster,
Mr. Krabs.

It's a horse.

She's my friend.

Her name is Mystery.

You're a mystery,
Spongebob.

[ laughs]

Get rid of it.

Huh? Please,
Mr. Krabs,
let her stay.

She won't hurt
nobody no how.

It's either you or Mystery.

I knew I should have named her
Debbie.

Spongebob, thanks

for finally
getting rid of that horse.

You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.

Now if we could just get rid
of Squidward.

[ chuckles]

Good one, sir.

Ha! It worked, girl.

I'll just keep
you back here

until Patrick finishes
that stable

I asked him to build.

Only eight more hours.

No, Mystery.

You can't
come out yet.

If old man
Krabs sees you

I'll lose my job.

Wait a sec.

I'll bet you're hungry.

How about some lunch?

[ sniffs]

[ neighs]

Shh, girl, you got
to be quiet, or...

Spongebob, what was that?

Is that horse in here?

No, Mr. Krabs.

I was just doing my imitation
of Mystery.

[ fake neigh]

Well, keep working on it.

That was terrible.

That was close.

And from now on
no more high jinks.

Order up!

Spongebob, where's my order?

Did you look under the tray?

Oh, no I didn't. Sorry.

Spongebob, could you just
get my order?

They vanished.

Squidward, do you think
the Krusty Krab is haunted?

What if they come for me next?

I got to get
out of here!

Spongebob...

there's no ghosts.

Oh.

In case you've forgotten

here's how things work.

I order the food.

You cook the food.

Then the customer
gets the food.

We do that
for 40 years

and then we die.

Sounds like a pretty
good deal to me.

What do you say?

[ burps]

Yeah, I hear you,
Squidward.

I'll be right back.

What's that?

Don't tell Mr. Krabs.

I've got it all under control.

Now then, you were saying?

Just get my order.

You got it, Squidward.

[ chuckles]

Ghosts.

Mystery, you ate my hat.

[ burps]

Mystery,
you ate my spatula!

You ate all the Krabby patties.

You ate the stove!

You ate old man Jankins.

JANKINS:
I don't want to be a burden.

[ all yelling]

Folks, we have a minor situation
going on in the kitchen.

Where's our food?

I'm so hungry.

This is my
only lunch hour.

Where's
old man Jankins?

Take it easy.

The food's no good here anyway.

Squidward,
what's going on in here?

Why don't you go
ask Cowbob Ranch Pans

and his faithful
companion Sir
Eatsalot.

Spongebob, what's the meaning
of all these nicknames?

David H. Jones!

Mystery got a bellyache
from eating Krabby patties

so I made her a
bicarbonate of soda.

[ burps]

What did I miss?

So, my eyes arecorrect!

You still have that horse after
I ordered you to get rid of it!

Well, now, I'm going to get rid
of it once and for all.

No, Mr. Krabs, please don't
make me give up Mystery!

I know you think
she's just a horse

but she's more than that,
I tell you.

She listens to me.

She understands everything
I say and I understand her.

She's my best friend.

[ sniffling]

Hey, who left this bowl
of onions here?

Spongebob, your story
has touched me heart.

Believe it or not,
I know what's it like

to give up a best friend.

You do?

I was five years old

and me father gave me a dollar.

I loved that dollar.

Loved it like a brother.

Me and that dollar
went everywhere together.

What happened to the dollar,
Mr. Krabs?

And one day at the beach

it was so hot

and I was so thirsty.

I spent it on a soda.

My best friend.

[ sniffling and whimpering]

Would you get out of here?

The point is, son

sometimes you have
to set things free

even though it's hard.

Look at her.

She misses
the great outdoors.

The wide open spaces

the rolling
green pastures.

The kitchen is no place
for a live horse.

All right, Mr. Krabs,
I understand.

[ whimpering]

[ sobbing]

Hey!

Okay, girl,
you're free to go.

I can't keep
you anymore.

[ sobbing]

I know it's hard for
you to understand

but Mr. Krabs is right.

You belong in the wild.

Well, what are
you waiting for?

Can't you see I don't
want you anymore?

Just get out of here,
you stupid, dumb animal!

[ sobbing]

Well, she's gone

and I'll never see her again.

It's okay, son.

You did the proper thing.

She's free now

and we have no
right to separate
that wild animal

from its natural habitat.

SQUIDWARD:
Hey, Mr. Krabs.

Looks like ol' Mystery
had an afterdinner salad.

Get that horse!

Mystery...

Come back!

Mystery...

Mystery, come back here!

Thanks!

Barnacle head.

Pardon me?

You forgot
your mayonnaise.

Thanks.

Look at them eating
that garbage.

It's disgusting.

They're sickening.

I hate Krabby Patties.

[ laughs]

Good one, Squidward!

Good what?

Like you don't know.

Saying "I hate Krabby Patties."

That's hilarious!

Everyone loves Krabby Patties.

Yeah, well, not me.

You're good at that.

Hey, everyone!

Squid says he doesn't
like Krabby Patties. Ha!

[ all laughing]

Good one, Squidward!

[ laughing]

Don't encourage them!

They'll never leave.

Sorry, Squidward.

It's just so funny.

You know what we say:

ALL:
The only people
who don't like a Krabby Patty

have never tasted one.

That's me.

Never had one, never will.

What?

What?

What did you say?

I've never had a Krabby Patty

and never will.

I'm sorry... I don't...

I've never had a Krabby Patty.

Those words!

Is it possible to use them

in a sentence
together like that?

I've never had a Krabby Patty!
I've never had a Krabby Patty!
I've never had a Krabby Patty!

Never had a Krabby Patty?

Well, you've gotta have one
right now!

No wonder you're
always so miserable!

Here, try this!

Get that garbage
outta my face!

If you try it,
you'll love it!

Try one of those radioactive
sludge balls you call food?

Next I suppose you'll want me to
go squaredancing with Patrick.

Sorry, Patrick.

[ sighs]

Come on, you're gonna...

No.

Open up the tunnel.

Here comes the train.

Choochoo...

No!

Whoop! What's that
in your ear?

Quit it.

Come on, open wide!

SpongeBob,
if I were trapped

at the bottom of a
well for three years

with nothing to eat
but that Krabby Patty

I'd eat
my own legs first!

And not just
the extra ones.

But it's good for you!

Good for you?

That thing is a heart attack
on a bun!

No, Squidward, I meant...
good for your soul.

Oh, puhleez! I have no soul.

[ evil laughter]

Okay, just half.

No.

A quarter?

No.

One bite?

Just smell it.

If I didn't want it
out there

what makes you think
I'd find it

more appealing
in here?!

Come on, Squidward.

No.

One bite.

No.

You won't be sorry.

No!

It's delicious...

SpongeBob, how long are you
prepared to keep this up?

[ click]

Give me that!

When I die... you stay
away from my funeral.

Ohh... do I really...

Ah...

Ooh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

[ gulps]

Why... this Krabby Patty
may be the most...

Horrible!

Putrid!

Poorly prepared!
Vile!

Unappetizing!

Disgusting excuse
for a sandwich

it has ever been
my displeasure

to have slither
down my throat!

But..

And I curse
this Krabby Patty

and all who enjoy them
to an early

and welldeserved
grave!

Get it?

But it doesn't
make any sense

The Krabby Patty
is an absolute good.

Nobody is immune
to its tasty charms.

Nobody but me.

Are you sure?

Does this look unsure
to you?

No.

Good!

Now go spread the word.

[ gasps, panting]

Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

Ah...

Still alive!

Oh, so delicious!

[ crying...]

Oh...! The wasted years!

[ crying...]

I got to have more.
I got to have more!

But wait!

After that
performance

he'd never let me
live it down!

I gotta sneak one, just one...

then I'm off the stuff for good!

I didn't think it was possible

but I guess some people
just don't like Krabby Patties!

[ whistling...]

[ whistling...]

Uh, SpongeBob?

Yes, Squidward?

I need a Triple Krabby Supreme
on a kelp bun

with extra sea pickle and,
and burn it to a crisp, okay?

Coming right up!

Listen, Squidward.

I want to apologize
for before.

I was only trying
to make you happy.

[ moaning and groaning...]

[ voice echoes 
distantly...]

...but now
I've learned

there's room for
all kinds of people...

[ whimpers]

...and they don't
all have to like
the same things.

Don't go.

While I strongly
disagree

with your decision,
I accept it.

You know, it's not often
I get to make one like this.

I want to see the look
on their face

when they take
that first bite.

Triple Krabby Supreme!

Triple Krabby Supreme!

Did somebody order
a Triple Krabby Supreme?

Huh? They must have left.

Well, uh, why don't you
just uh, leave it out here

in case they come back.

Nope, a patty this special
should be eaten fresh

and... well... I haven't
had one of these babies

in over 20 minutes so...

[ gasps]

Well, whoever they were,
they had great taste!

[ groaning and chattering]

Mm, mmhmmhmm,
mmhmmhmmhmm...

Ah, they don't know
what they're missing.

Well, back to work.

What do I have to do?

Eat one out of the garbage?

I wish I could eat this,
but I'm so darn full.

Oh well.

I had to say garbage...
but okay!

[ inhales deeply]

[ munching and clattering]

Bleah...

Oh no, what's this
doing here?

This patty should
be cremated!

I know you didn't
like him

but it means so much
that you came.

[ continues crying...]

[ knock on door]

I have got to get my hands

And no one's going to stop me.

There it is...

Holy shrimp!

I don't know where to start.

All that matters is that

it's just you... and me...
and nobody...

SPONGEBOB:
Squidward?

Is that you?

SpongeBob?

Uh, uh, uh...
what are you doing here?

I always come to work
at 3:00 a.m.

This is when I count
the sesame seeds.

What are you doing here?

Uh... I forgot my...

And why is
the patty vault open?

And why are you holding
a patty behind your back?

I... I... I...
no, I didn't do...

And why are you
acting so nervous?

And why are you
sweating so much?

And why do you look so hungry?

No, wait... it's
not what you think.

Ththis is a big
misunderstanding.

You've got to
believe me, I...

Listen, I am
telling you...

You better listen
to me, SpongeBob.

You like Krabby Patties,
don't you, Squidward?

Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob!

I loveKrabby Patties!

I knew it all along,
Squidward.

No one can resist
a Krabby Patty.

[ chomping and gulping...]

Squidward!
How many are you eating?

Squidward!

[ laughing wildly]

[ munching]

Squidward, you can't eat
all those patties at one time!

Squidward!

What's gonna happen?

Am I gonna blow up?

No, worseit'll go
right to your thighs...

My thighs?

...and then
you'll blow up.

Is it the "homework pencil"

next to the "quiz pencil"

or over on the right side,
all by itself... or...

I think it goes
stuck inside your...

Wait! I got it!

The "quiz pencil"
goes right over here

next to the "essay" pencil.

And the "essay" pencil
gets turned sideways

towards the notepad.

I have to write an essay.

MRS. PUFF:
Good morning, class!

Sorry I'm late...

I got caught in traffic
on the way here

when that whole
"I'm gonna be doing this
for the rest of my life" thing

reared its ugly head

and I...
[ laughs nervously]

Anyway, we have a new student
starting today.

So let's all put on a happy face

for Flats the Flounder.

[ applauding]

Tell the class something
about yourself, Flats.

Well, I like to
kick people's butts.

[ laughing]

[ applause]

What a card.

Now, Flats, it's time
to pick your seat.

Just go ahead
and sit anywhere you like.

MRS. PUFF:
Okay, class,
as you remember last week...

Hi, I'm SpongeBob.

Hi, SpongeBob.

I'm gonna
kick your butt.

Whoa!

[ laughs]

That joke was almost
funnier the second time.

No... I mean it.

[ giggles] That time
it almost seemed like...

...you did mean it.

Mrs. Puff.

Yes, SpongeBob?

Can I be excused
for the rest of my life?

[ laughs]
Why no, SpongeBob.

I'm in the middle of a coffee
fueled sermon right now.

You can't afford
to miss this information.

Yes, Mrs.Puff.

Sorry, Mrs. Puff.

Now... can I please
have a volunteer

to come up to the board?

How about you, Flats?

Please draw for us a diagram

of a basic fourway
intersection, Flats.

[ chalk squeaking]

Please turn
and show the class

what you drew, honey.

[ gibbers]

[ gasps] My!
How very creative!

We have an artist
in the class!

[ applause...]

[ panting...]

SPONGEBOB:
I just don't understand.

Why would Flats
want to kick mybutt?

I haven't said
two words to the guy!

Hi, I'm SpongeBob.

One... two... [ gasps]

Oh no, that's three!

What am I gonna do?

[ creaking and clattering]

What's that?! Someone's coming.

They're getting closer.

I just got to act natural.

Oh, that's real nice.

Whew!
I thought for sure
that was gonna be...

Flats?!

Uh, hello, um... sir.

Uh... kicked any
good butts lately?

Yeah, I remember
last week

I was kickin' this
guy's butt real good...

and he leans over and says...

"Hey, ya know... life's like
a bucket of wood shavings,

"except for when the shavings
are in a pail...

then it's like a pail
of wood shavings."
[ laughs]

Hey, that story
really speaks to me.

Really? What's it say?

It says now I'm gonna
kick your butt twice as hard.

It says now I'm gonna
kick your butt twice as hard.

And I'll leave
Gary's water bowl to Gary

and my curtains to...

Oh, Neptune,
I just can't do this!

Death row.
"Nextinline" speaking.

PATRICK:
Hi! I'd like to place
an order for delivery.

Patrick! Is that you?

Yeah. Hey, Mario.

Let me get a large,
double olive, double...

Patrick, listen!
It's me, SpongeBob!

I need your help.

You're working
at Pizza Castle now?

What? No... listen!

I'm in big trouble.

There's a new guy at school here
and he wants kick my butt.

Listen, you're big and strong.

Do you think
you can come down here...

maybe rough him up a bit,
just to get him off my back?

Please, Patrick!

I'm so scared it feels
like I'm gonna throw up.

No, they're not closed...

I know, you want olives...

Patrick? You there?

Oh, I'm sorry,
SpongeBob.

I was just talking
to my old community
college buddy, Flats.

I bumped into him
at the soda store,
isn't that funny?

It must have been years
since we've seen each other.

Well, let me get going.

He's got to go
back to school soon.

He says he's got to
kick somebody's butt.

Aah...!

Hello?
Is this Pizza Castle?

Aah...!

Come in, SpongeBob.

Mrs. Puff, can I be
in a different class?

But why?

I can't tell you.

Why ever not?

I just can't, Mrs. Puff.

My physical being is at stake.

Let's just leave it at that.

SpongeBob,
you can tell me anything.

You've got to believe that.

Well... okay.

But only if you promise
to keep it between us.

Of course.

Flats says
he's gonna kick my butt!

What?! There shall be
no buttkicking

in any class of mine.

This is an adult program.

SpongeBob, just leave it to me.

Aw, thanks, Mrs. Puff.

I knew I could count on you.

[ bell rings]

Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?

Yes, Mrs. Puff.

[ whispers]:
Psst! SpongeBob!

I talked to Flats for you.

I used your name.

It was all
a misunderstanding.

You what?!

He was never going to
kick your butt at all.

You see, SpongeBob,
Flats is from a town

where "kicking
someone's butt"

means that he wants
to be your friend

and maybe play

some sports with you
on weekends.and maybe play

some sports with you
on weekends.

I got diarrhea.

[ gibbering]

Huh?

Are you Flats's Dad?

Why, yes, I am.

Okay, see...

I didn't know
where else to turn!

Patrick couldn't
help me

and Mrs. Puff
only made it worse!

I sit next to your son
Flats in school

and he is a fine boy
and all

and I don't want you
to take this the wrong way

but he wants
to kick my butt.

Dad, what
are you doing?

Uh, nothing, son.

What did I tell you

about talking
to strangers?

Now he's going
to kick mybutt.

Aah...!

Out of my way! Out of my way!

Can't you see
he's going to kick my butt?!

Hi there, young people!

Nice day today.

So you like kickin'
butts, do ya?

Well, we'll show you,
old man.

[ crowd yelling 
and punching...]

[ whimpering]

[ panting]

Okay, okay,
I got to skip town!

Start a new life!
Live under an assumed name!

BobPants SpongeSquare!
Yeah, that's good.

Grow a beard
and then shave it off....

and live happily ever after.

Yeah, except
you forgot the part

where I kick your butt!

[ gasping]

[ panting and whimpering...]

[ snickers]

Whoa...!

[ Flats groaning]

Hey, Flats.

You feeling better?

Whwhhat? Where am I?

Why, you're
in the hospital.

This young boy

He performed CPR
for five hours straight.

Yeah... they said you'd be okay
after the first few minutes

but I just wanted to be sure.

Wow! I'm touched.

I'll have to remember that
when I'm kicking your butt.

Those flowers for me?

Aah...!

He's still gonna kick my butt!

How many times
do we have to

teach you this
lesson, old man?

I love the young people.

[ crowd mutters angrily]

Aah...!

Oh Gary! I'm too young
to have my butt kicked.

There are so many things in life
that I haven't gotten to do!

Hang on...
I'll transfer your call.

[ banging on door]

Who is it?

Aah...! Flats!

It's buttkicking time.

Gary, there's something
I want you to know.

but I'm too scared
to remember what it is.

[ cracking knuckles]

[ gasps]

[ cracking]

[ gasps]

[ gasps]

Let's do it.

Go away, Gary.

I don't want you to see this,
it'll be ugly.

Are you ready?

Hold on.

Okay, I'm ready.

[ grunts]

I said, I'm ready.

Huh?

[ grunts]

Didn't you hear me?

I said I'm ready.

[ grunts]

[ giggles]
That tickled!

Flats was

NARRATOR: 
Oh, a dark and stormy night.

It's nights like this 
that remind me of the time

Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob 
thought they killed 
the health inspector.

It was a bright 
and sunny morning...

Ah...

[ sniffs]

That smells like...

[ gasps]

The health inspector!

Wash your hands,
clean the floors

change
your underwear!

The health
inspector's here!

If he finds one
health violation

he'll close us
down for good.

We've got to
do everything
in our power

to make sure
he passes
The Krusty Krab.

But, Mr. Krabs,
there's no reason to worry.

The Krusty Krab is the most
perfect place in the universe.

You really haven't got any
brains at all, have you, son?

Just go out there and
give him what he needs.

Pour on the charm.

Sweettalk him.

What can I get for
you... Handsome?

We're doomed!

I'm going to need you
to bring me

one of everything on the menu.

Excellent choice, my darling.

Coming right up!

He wants one of everything!

Then we'll give him
a smorgasbord!

The future of The Krusty Krab
is at stake.

Try the Crunchy
Kelp Dogs, sir.

The Buttered Barnacles
are heaven.

The Powdered Driftwood
is exquisite.

Sludge Pudding?

More Diet Red Tide?

Fried Flotsam?

Please, gentlemen!

[ gulps]

Leave me to finish my work
in peace.

[ burps]

And did the voluptuous
inspector enjoy his meal?

So far so good.

I just need to try
a plain Krabby Patty

and my inspection
will be finished.

He says if he gets
one more Krabby Patty

he'll pass us
for the inspection!

Do you know what
this means, dear boy?

We're in the clear!

[ cancan playing]

TV ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this cancan

for a special news bulletin.

Be on the lookout for a man

who's been passing himself off
as a health inspector

in order to obtain free food.

That's all for now.

Free... food..!

Maybe we ought to tell our guy
about the phony impostor.

You loony loofah!
He isthe impostor!

We've been duped!

Duped!

Bamboozled!

Smeckledorfed!

That's not even a word

and I agree with ya!

Look at him...

I bet he never
changes his underpants.

SPONGEBOB:
I bet he bites
whale bubbles.

I bet his mom
bought him that hat.

If that impostor
wants a Krabby Patty...

Then, by Neptune,
we'll give him one!

You're dancing with
the Krab man now!

Join me, boy,
or you're fired.

It doesn't seem right...

but it feels so good!

Sea horse radish, the
gnarliest stuff in the ocean!

Oh, hold on! I've got a jar of
toenail clippings in my office.

Oops, I dropped it
in the toilet.

Well, fish it out and
I'll dry it with me gym socks!

[ SpongeBob snickers]

MR. KRABS:
Why, that's the most diabolical
Krabby Patty ever spawned.

I call it...
The Nasty Patty.

[ both laugh]

Hey, hurry up
with that patty!

Here you are sir, enjoy.

Ah! Hello, delicious!

Come to papa.

[ buzzes]

[ gagging, fly buzzing]

Listen! He ate it!

Look at him choke!

[ both laugh]

[ choking]

Look at him suffer!

[ laughing]

[ coughing, choking]

[ laughing]

Did you see that boy?

Oh, man,
the look on his face!

[ choking...]

[ groaning]

[ fly buzzing]

[ laughing]

TV ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt your laughter
at other people's expense

to bring you this news flash!

The fake inspector
has been captured.

Here is his picture.

If a health inspector
comes to your restaurant

and he's not this guy...
he's real.

Phew! That's a relief,
eh, Mr. Krabs?

I'm sure our guy
will understand

if we just explain
the situation.

Then we can all have
a good laugh about it.

[ gasps]

I don't think
he'll be laughing, boy.

Why, sir?

Because that patty
killed him!

[ both scream]

[ screaming]

Mr. Krabs, what
are we gonna do?

What's this "we" stuff?

You fed him
the tainted patty!

Looks like it's
the stony lonesome for you.

But you told me
to give it to him!

Well, you could have
talked me out of it!

You're right, Mr. Krabs...
I'm guilty!

I'll never survive in prison.

They'll mop up the floor
with me!

Get a hold
of yerself, boy!

We got to get rid
of this body

before anyone sees it.

We got to take it out
and bury it.

Eww, gross, germs.

It's all icky
and corpsey!

[ gagging]

[ shrieking]

Eww... eww...

This should be far enough.

Now, get diggin'!

Yes, sir.

[ clank]

What's the holdup
down there?

There's a big rock
in the way!

Well, toss it out
and get back to diggin'!

Aye, aye, sir!

[ grunting]

Oh... where am I?

[ grunts, groans]

Somethin' ain't
quite right.

What do you mean,
Mr. Krabs?

His head's sticking out!

Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I thought
he might need some air.

They don't need air
where he's goin'.

Shouldn't we say a few
words on his behalf?

Uh... he was a credit
to health inspectors
everywhere, and, uh...

What a brave man, going in
the line of duty like that.

Why... why... why..?!

Listen here,
ya little barnacle.

No one, and I mean no one
can ever know about this.

It'll be the end of you,
it'll be the end of me.

And worst of all,
it'll be the end of me!

MAN:
Stop right where you are!

I'm afraid we're gonna have to
arrest the two of you.

Mr. Krabs!
I'm too young
to go to jail!

And what would be
the charges?

For not being
at The Krusty Krab

to whip us up a couple of
dee...licious Krabby Patties.

[ both laugh]

[ laughs weakly]

[ whispers]:
Laugh, boy.

[ laughing nervously]

[ thunder booming, 
laughter continues...]

Put that muddy shovel
in the trunk

and we'll give you
a ride back.

[ laughing]

SpongeBob,
listen carefully.

We're just getting a lift
back to the Krusty Krab.

I need you to stay calm
and don't lose your cool,
understand?

Can I lose my cool now?

Why?

BOTH:
Aah!

Put him in the trunk, boy!

I'll keep them cops busy.

MAN:
What's the holdup
back there?

Oh, Neptune!

Get away!

Ooh... ahhahh...

Ahem...

Okay! All set
back here.

Nothing unusual about
a muddy shovel in the trunk.

[ laughs nervously]

All set.

Ahh...

You okay there,
little fella?

Ooh, he gets carsick
real easy.

Well, buckle up and
we'll drive real smoothlike.

[ siren wails, 
tires squeal]

Now listen, SpongeBob

when we get
to the Krusty Krab

I want you to take

that shovel

and bring it around
to the back entrance

and stuff... er...
I mean, stow it
in the freezer.

Un... der... stand?

I understand, Mr. Krabs

but what do you want me
to do with the bo...

...tles of soda!
Bottles of soda.

Same thing, put 'em
in the freezer.

Oh...

[ laughing nervously]

Eww... eww... eww...

Oh, man, this is so gross!

The back door is locked!

What am I gonna do?!

[ both laugh]

Ahoy there, SpongeBob.

Heh. I thought
you were out back

takin' care of that shovel.

Well, the back door was locked,
so I came around here... eh.

So if you'll excuse me

I'm gonna go put my hat
in the freezer now.

Okeydokey, SpongeBob.

Is that kid okay?

He's actin'
a little funny.

Funny? Oh. Yeah.
[ laughs]

He's a real cutup,
that one.

He knows how to keep
the crew in stitches.

Good one, boy!

Always on, that one.

There's no off
on his funny switch.

[ laughing]

Oh, ha, oh, stop it.

Oh, you're,
you're killin' me.

[ laughing]

[ laughing]

Oh!

Look, I almost forgot!

It's open cash
register night!

First two customers
get all the money

in the cash register!

[ police radio chatter]

[ indecipherable voice]

86 those patties, Krabs.

We just got a call
about two ghouls

burying a stiff
over by Shallow Grave Road.

I want a soda.

Here's your soda.

Always a pleasure.

Well, goodbye now.

Hey, there's no ice.

Ice? Ice? You want ice?

Is that what you want,
you want ice?

The dark deed
you requested

is done, sir.

Ice is in the freezer, ri...?

There is no ice!

There's never been any ice.

Ice is just a myth!

Step aside.

You people act like
you've committed a murder!

Okay! I confess!

SpongeBob killed him!

What? You can't pin
this whole rap on me!

He was insane, out of control.

He would have killed me, too

if you hadn't come along.

It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.

Put him down now,
he's a mad dog!

He wears curlers
to bed!

Wait! It's not
what you think!

What are you two
talking about?

We killed
the health inspector

buried him, and then stuffed
his body in the freezer.

You mean in here?

It's empty.

Is this
some kind of joke?

Yeah... a joke!

[ laughs]

Say, maybe he
turned into a zombie

and walked out.

[ all laughing]

[ thumping footsteps 
and eerie groaning...]

[ groaning]

Aah! It's the zombie!

You guys should...

Take that, you zombie!

I'll take it
from here.

Die, zombie!

Good police work,
Officer Nancy.

Hey, this guy's
not a zombie.

He's just an ordinary
health inspector.

Yes, and at the risk
of being hit again

I'd like to present you
with this.

Hey, Mr. Krabs, look.

We passed the inspection!

[ all cheer]

MR. KRABS:
Come on, everybody!

Krabby Patties
at half price!

Well, not really.

Oh boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty.

Well, that's the story.

Yes, theyare 
all idiots, aren't they?

[ wind blowing...]

See anything yet,
Patrick?

I need my glasses.

Hmm...

It's the mail truck!

BOTH:
Our package!

I didn't realize it was
Happy Hopping Moron Day.

SpongeBob
SquarePants?

That's me!

That's a big box!

Thank you.

Hey, SpongeBob?

When do we stop hopping?

30 more seconds,
Patrick.

Probably ordered a lifetime
supply of bubble soap.

[ snickers]

[ both grunting]

Huh?! A brand new television?

Easy... easy...

[ whooping and cheering]

[ both giggling]

Just when I thought they
couldn't get any stupider.

Let me get this straight.

You two ordered
a giantscreen television

just so you could play
in the box?

Pretty smart, huh?

I thought
it wouldn't work.

Yeah, that's quite
a plan there.

Oh, but wait...

There's something else
I wanted to ask you two.

Now, what was it?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Don't you two
have any brains?!

Squidward, we don't
need television.

Not as long as we have

our imagina... tion.

Wow! I never thought of it
that way.

That's really something.

Can I have your TV?

With imagina...tion,
I can be anything I want.

A pirate! Arr!

A football player! Hup!

A starfish.

Patrick, you're
already a starfish.

See, Squidward,
it works! You try!

Okay, let's see...

I'm imagining myself
watching TV...

And there it is!

Can I have it, SpongeBob?

Sure, Squidward.

Oh, boy, oh, boy!

Okay, Squidward!

If you change your mind

we'll be in this box.

Let's play
"mountain climbing adventure"!

Let's go for it!

Gloves?
Check!

Hats?
Check!

Underwear?
Uh... check!

Okay, Patrick,
climb up there

and secure this rope.

You got it!

[ grunting and clattering]

SPONGEBOB:
Patrick...
Patrick...

Patrick!
You're going too high!

I hope they put
some air holes in that box.

Take it easy, Patrick!

You've got to acclimate!

I'll take it easy
when I'm dead!

I'm
shaking hands
with Neptune!

Whoo! 
Excelsior!

Where's that
remote?

I am the lizard
king! Whoo!

Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick!

I think we should
keep our voices down!

We might start
an avalanche!

What?

I said I think we should
keep our voices down

in case of avalanches!

What should we
keep down?

Morons.

Our voices!

Will you two shut up!

[ booming, cracking, 
screaming]

[ crying and moaning]

SpongeBob?

[ booming, cracking, 
screaming]

[ sobbing]

Hold me.

Hang in there, buddy,
the chopper is on the way!

SpongeBob! My legs
are frozen solid.

You'll have to cut
them off with a saw.

No, Patrick,
I can't do that!

Why not?

Because I already cut off
my own arms.

No..!

What the..?

How were you two
making that noise?!

[ laughs]

What noise, Squidward?

I could only hear the
sound of our laughter.

Yes! But those sound effects:
the avalanche, the, the, the...

Don't forget the
second avalanche.

Forget it!

I don't know why
I'm wasting my time out here

when I could be watching
my brand new television.

[ helicopter flying low]

MAN:
Attention, climbers!
Please hold on!

The saws are on the way!

BOTH:Yay!

Aha!

How are you doing that?

First we establish
a base camp at 15,000 feet.

The noises! How are you two
making those noises?

That's easy,
all you need is a box...

And imagina... tion!

Are you trying to say
I have no imagination?

I have more imagina... tion
in one tentacle

than you two have
in your whole bodies!

That's good.

Now all you need
is a box!

I'll show them!

There's got to be one in here!

Ah! This hat box
should do nicely.

Why haven't I worn this yet?

Grr... oh...

[ siren wails]

MAN:
Attention! We have
you surrounded!

Come out
with your hands up!

What do they want with me?

What did I do?

Obviously I violated
some new boxkicking law!

Look, officers!
Everything's okay.

I won't do it again!

SPONGEBOB:
You'll never take me
alive, coppers!

MAN:
No, Johnny!
Don't do it!

[ siren wailing]

Grr...

[ siren stops]

Whoopee, another box!

[ siren wailing...]

I got to try to relax.

Perhaps I can drown out their
childish games with a little TV.

It is here that the boxes reach 
their final stage of assembly.

The equation is illustrated here
by this box.

I couldn't afford
a present this year

so I got you this box.

That's what I got you!

Isn't there anything on
that isn't about boxes?!

And welcome back 
to Championship Boxing.

Hehheh! I guess this is okay.

I mean, it's not really
about boxes.

[ bell clangs]

[ crowd cheering]

I give up.

[ rocket engine rumbles]

MAN:
Three... two... one...
blast off!

[ whooshing]

How are they doing that?

That was the most realistic
space launch I've ever heard.

There must be an explanation.

Think, Squidward, think!

[ giggling]

Shh!

[ rocket engine rumbles]

Squidward's such a jerk.

[ giggling]

Laugh at me, will they?!

All right, where is it?

Here I am!

Where's what,
Squidward?

Don't "Where's what,
Squidward?" me!

Where's the tape recorder?

We don't have a tape
recorder, Squidward.

Don't "We don't have a tape
recorder, Squidward" me.

But we don't.

We have a tape recorder box.

All right! Make way, you two,
I'm comin' in!

Welcome aboard,
Squidward.

You've just set sail
on the S.S.Imagina...tion!

Where our
only destination

is fantastic
adventure.

Where do you want to
go first?

No, no, don't mind me,
I'm just here to observe.

But, Squidward,
don't you see?

Waiting and watching?

That's not what
the box is about.

It's about 
imagina... tion!

All right, fine!

Take me to Robot Pirate Island!

I want to armwrestle
with cowboys on the moon!

Just do it so I can
get back and watch TV.

Okay, Squidward,
Robot Pirate Island
it is!

Beepbeepbeep.

Arr...

Beepboopbeepboop.

Ahoy, matey!

Beepbeep.

For that you'll
walk the plank!

[ giggling]

Grr...

Why won't this thing
turn on?!

All right, fine!

You don't want to show me,
I don't care!

I've got better things
to do

than pace the floor

wondering how you two
work this thing.

How do those two
work that thing?

There's got to be
a secret button

or a switch or something.

I mean, listen to that!

[ yelling, clanging, beeping]

Now that sounds
like Robot Pirate Island.

Think, Squidward, think!

I got it!

When those two go to bed

I'll sneak in there
and find that button.

I'll wait all night
if I have to!

[ yelling, clanging, beeping]

[ yawns]

I need sleep to refuel
my imagination tanks!

SPONGEBOB:
I still can't believe

those pirates beat
all those robots!

See you in the morning!

Good night, Patrick!

[ snickers]

Hmm?

Hello, what's this?

"This plaque is to commemorate

"the brave pirates
who gave their lives

"to keep this box safe
from the Robot Menace.

Lest we forget..."

Oh! Got to find
that button quick!

It's got to be here somewhere!

I don't see anything!

It's just an empty box!

Maybe it really was
their imagination.

Oh... get it together,
Squidward!

What are you saying?

I mean, do I really believe

that if I sit here and
pretend to drive a race car

that I'm suddenly going to
start hearing noises?

[ engine revving]

What the?

It actually works!

I can't believe it.

Oh, boy!
This beats TV by a long shot!

[ laughing and whooping]

[ truck engine revving]

SQUIDWARD:
This is the most fun
I've ever had!

Listen to that, Gary.

Squidward finally made
the box work after all!

That is so great.

[ Squidward laughing]

Vroomvroom! Only two more laps
till the finish line!

I'm in the lead!
Out of my way!

I'm almost there!

[ laughing]

[ whooping]

Victory is mine!

Aah!

[ grunting]

Hey! Our box is gone!

Oh, well.

I know! Let's go

I hope he's not too
down in the dumps today.

Please don't tell!

Oh, I'm telling.

If Mermaidman finds out,

he'll kick me out
of his fan club for sure!

Please don't tell!

Uhoh!

There's the phone.

Don't!

I'm walking

towards the phone.

No!

I'm getting closer

to the phone.

[ sobbing]:
Don't!

And now for the moment

we've all been waiting for.

I'm begging you!

Hello.

I'd like to speak to Mer...

[ ray zapping]

What did... Ow!

MERMAIDMAN:
Hello? Hello?

What did you do to me?!

I'm sorry,
but you made me do it!

SpongeBob, if you don't return
me to normal size right now,

you are going to be

in really big trouble.

Uh... uh... okay.

I said now!

Uh...

[ belt beeping and whirring]

SPONGEBOB:
Uh... uh...

Uh...

Do you hear me?!

[ ray zapping]

Holy fish paste!

Get it off me!

Get it off me!

[ panting]

Don't you know
how to work that thing?

Uh, I can do it!

[ ray zapping]

[ screaming]

[ ray zapping]

[ shouting]

[ ray zapping]

[ shrieking]

[ ray zapping]

[ shrieks]

[ ray zapping; 
Squidward screaming]

[ Squidward choking 
and slurping]

[ ray zapping; screaming]

Stop!

I've got an idea.

Let's call Mermaidman and...

No!

I can't let you
do that!

But there must be
someone else who
can help.

Someone smart
and wise

with years
of life experience.

Patrick!

[ snoring]

Patrick, Patrick!

[ gasping]

Oh, hi, SpongeBob!

I was at work

and Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy came,

and I got this belt
and look!

A Squidward
action figure!

Let me play with him!

No, Patrick!

Fighter pilot!

[ imitating plane]

[ imitating machine guns]

[ imitating explosions]

Dive bomb!

Patrick!

And then
a giant fist!

Patrick, no!

That's not
an action figure,

that's the real
Squidward.

I shrunk him
by accident.

Oh.

And then comes
a giant...

Wait, you don't
understand!

This is serious!

I don't know how
to unshrink him.

He could be stuck
like this

for the rest
of his life.

Oh, don't worry
about it.

He'll find love
one day.

You think so?

Sure, but it'll be

with someone his own size.

Like this pickle!

See?

They like each other!

No, no, no, no.

[ pickle slurping]

[ Patrick imitating kissing]

Oh, if only I knew
how to work this thing.

Let me take a look at it.

Hmm...

You know what
the problem is?

What?

You got it set
to "M", for mini.

When it should be set
to "W", for "wumbo."

Patrick, I don't think
"wumbo" is a real word.

Come on.

You know:

I wumbo, you wumbo,
hesheme wumbo.

Wumbo, wumboing...

I wonder if a fall
from this height

would be enough to kill me.

Wumbology?

The study of wumbo?

It's first grade,
SpongeBob!

Patrick, I'm sorry
I doubted you.

Well, all right, then.

Let 'er rip!

[ zapping]

It worked!

Oh, no!

Look!

SpongeBob's
giant!

Can I be giant next?

Patrick, I'm not giant.

You've shrunk, too!

You're kidding!

Good thing I've still
got this pickle!

[ kissing pickle loudly]

Hey, now will you
take us to Mermaidman?!

No!

He can never find out!

But I'll think of something.

I promise.

Until then,
you'll be safe in this jar.

You know
what's funny?

My pickle started out
in a jar,

and now it's
in one again.

Huh, it's like
a pun or something.

[ chuckles]

It's only two people.

No big deal.

Nobody else saw it.

Howdy, SpongeBob!

Sandy!

What did you...
For cryin'...

What did ya'll
do to me?

I'm sorry, Sandy!

Mermaidman came in, and...

Hey, SpongeBob...

[ shrieks]

Hey,
SpongeBob?

[ screams]

Hi, SpongeBob.

[ shouting]

[ screams]

Hello, SpongeBob.

Whoo!

SpongeDude!

[ shrieks]

[ different voices 
greeting SpongeBob]

[ SpongeBob screaming; 
small ray zapping]

[ faint shouting]

Whew! I'm gonna
have to get a bigger jar.

SQUIDWARD:
SpongeBob, will you
just face facts?

You've shrunken everybody
in Bikini Bottom.

You've got to go to Mermaidman.

Oh, Squidward,
he'll be so disappointed!

Well, you can't
leave us small forever.

You don't understand!

WOMAN [ gently]:
SpongeBob...

You need to admit your mistake.

Mom?

Your mother's
right, son.

Mermaidman
will understand.

You're Mermaidman,
you old coot!

Oh, yeah.

Mermaidman?

I'm so sorry.

It's just that
I'm such a big fan,

and your belt... and...

MERMAIDMAN:
Aw, don't worry, son.

I understand.

Why, I remember back when
I first used the belt,

the year was nineteen,
aught, eleventytwelve.

Why, I believe
the president then was...

ALL:
Just tell him
how to unshrink us!

Oh, yes, the unshrink ray.

Let's see, uh... uh...

Did you set it to wumbo?

ALL:
What?

[ rumbling]

[ all shouting angrily]

ALL:
Get SpongeBob!

[ all shouting]

Now I have to drive
five miles

to go to the bathroom

in my own home!

And I need
an elevator

to climb one stair!
[ shouts]

We've been
shrinking

for years!

But this is
ridiculous.

[ body squeaking and whistling 
with every hit]

MOB:
Everything's too big!

I've got it.

[ saw rasping]

[ small ray zapping]

Tada!

Since I couldn't make you big,
I made the city small.

[ all cheering]

And now only
one more thing to shrink.

Cheese!

I guess
this is okay.

Yeah, what's
the difference?

Good idea,
SpongeBob.

[ all cheering]

Well, it's great
to be back!

[ faint cheering]

Huh?

SPONGEBOB:
Don't worry, Mrs. Puff,
this is the one.

[ Mrs. Puff screams]

SPONGEBOB:
SpongeBob, think, think!

Turn that way, turn that way!

No, turn that way,
left, left!

[ Mrs. Puff screaming]

[ crash]

SPONGEBOB:
I can do this, Mrs. Puff.

I can do it, I can do it.

[ crash]

The driving test is over,
SpongeBob!

Stop the boat!

Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff.

I can do this.

MRS. PUFF:
Oh!

The road, SpongeBob!

Get back
on the road!

Got to pass the test!
Got to pass!

[ Mrs. Puff screams]

Hey! What do you got
against the melons?!

Look out!

This must be
the nightdriving test.

We're going to straighten
you out!

This'll fix you!

[ both grunting]

Now let's get that one!

[ Mrs. Puff screams]

Barnacles!
Did you see that?

Yeah! That guy had
no front license plate!

Let's get him.

[ Mrs. Puff squealing]

[ sirens blaring]

Hey, look at all
those police.

I wonder if
the president's in town.

[ screaming]:
Look out!

It is with great pride

that I officially open
this unfinished bridge!

[ Mrs. Puff screaming]

Where did I go wrong?

With the opening
of my new boating school,

I pledge that as long as
a student is willing to learn,

I shall never give up.

Hi, I'm SpongeBob
SquarePants!

[ screaming]

[ sirens blaring]

[ truck horn blowing]

Hurry up with that truckload
of fruit punch!

The seniors are getting cranky.

[ Mrs. Puff screaming]

[ crash]

Alive!

I'm alive!

Oh, thank Neptune,
I'm still...

[ crash]

[ many crashes]

[ sirens blaring, 
truck creaking]

[ juice splashes]

All right, seniors,
let's open these windows

so the world can see
your nice white clothes.

[ juice splashes]

[ over radio]:
Gonna be a surfin'...

[ juice splashes]

Surfin'

Surfin', it's gonna...

It's finally finished!

A memoir of my life,
written in red ink.

[ juice splashes]

Oh, barnacles!

[ siren blaring]

[ groans]

SpongeBob, are you okay?

That depends.

Did I pass?

OFFICER:
Freeze!

You're under arrest.

Hold it.

You can't arrest him.

He's just
a student driver.

We're not talking
about him.

[ door clangs]

But I don't belong here!

It's all a big mistake.

PRISONER:
Yeah, I don't belong here,
either.

PRISONER 2:
Me, too. I'm innocent.

PRISONER 3:
I belong here!

Okay, you can do this, Puff.

You can get through this
without losing your sanity.

Oh, that's a road we don't want
to go down again.

Positives!

Think of the positives.

Let's see...

I've got no more papers
to grade.

Yeah!

[ laughs]

In... in fact, no more work.

No more boating school classes.

No more driving.

No more SpongeBob!

[ sonar pinging]

No more phone solicitors.

No more SpongeBob.

No more company potlucks.

No more SpongeBob.

No more road rage.

No more SpongeBob.

No more insurance payments.

No more SpongeBob.

[ increasingly manic]:
No more SpongeBob.

No more SpongeBob!

No more SpongeBob...!!

I think I'm going
to likethis place.

SPONGEBOB:
Class just isn't the same

without Mrs. Puff.

Just the thought of her,
alone and afraid in jail

it makes me think about her
being alone and afraid in jail.

I don't know how
she's going to survive.

[ scatting cheerfully]

Smelling the pretty roses.

[ laughing]

Happiness is just
two kinds of ice cream.

Oh, that poor woman.

And it's all my fault.

Maybe if I go talk to Patrick,
he can ease my guilt.

Well, it sounds like
it's all your fault.

Oh, you're right.

Mrs. Puff's in jail,
and it's all because of me.

I'm such
a barnaclehead.

Poor Mrs. Puff.

I know! I got to get her out.

But to get her outof jail,
first we got to get injail.

How we going
to do that?

SPONGEBOB [ shouting]:
All right, put the money
in the bag!

Put it in!

Um, you're facing
the wrong way, sir.

[ laughs]

[ screaming]:
All right,

give me the money!

Will that be from your savings

or your checking account, sir?

Uh, savings.

May I please see
some identification?

Sure. There you go.

Thank you.

Sir, we are
showing a balance

of zero dollars
and zero cents

for both of your accounts.

Oh.

Next!

That went better
than expected.

Yeah, I didn't think we'd get
Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast.

Don't worry, Patrick,
we'll get into jail this time.

Hey, there's a couple.

[ grunts]

GUARD:
Put your back in it, girls!

Look, Patrick,
there she is.

Mrs. Puff, wait!

[ softly]:
It's usSpongeBob
and Patrick.

[ chuckling]:
That's funny.

For a second, I thought
that yellow rock talked to me,

and its voice
sounded a lot like...

SpongeBob.
It's me, SpongeBob.

[ screams]

We're going to bust you
out of here.

Come on, Mrs. Puff!

It's you!

What are you
doing here?

Why did you follow
me in here?

Why?

All right,
Mrs. Puff.

It looks like
this heat's gone
to your head.

If you're going to talk
to rocks,

it's time for you
to go on kitchen duty.

Yes!

It... it must be the heat.

Yes!

Darn it!

Okay, Patrick,
let's get out of here!

No, wait!

SPONGEBOB:
There goes our deposit
on these costumes.

There you are!

Hey there,
Puff Mama!

What's today's grub?

Hi, Donna.

It's chili, same as always.

Let me get you some.

[ gasps]

Mrs. Puff,

it's me, SpongeBob.

When are these horrific
hallucinations going to end?

No, it's really me!

I brought Patrick
along, too!

Hi.

Why?!

Because we're going
to set you free!

No, I mean, why'd you bring him?

[ sniffs]

[ chewing]

He likes chili.

Now, quick, get in
before someone sees!

SpongeBob, I am not
going with you.

[ laughs]:
That's a good one,
Mrs. Puff.

Now hop in, come on.

SpongeBob,
I think she means it.

Oh, that's crazy,
Patrick.

He's right, SpongeBob.

I'm staying.

But why?

I like it here.

These are my people.

And besides, if I'm in here,

that means I won't have to deal
with you... you...

[ sniffling]

Uranium in
the water supply!

See? Crystal clear.

[ gulping]

Ah.
[ glass crashes]

Excuse us just
one second, Mrs. Puff.

Patrick,
she has lost it!

She's completely
institutionalized.

She's forgotten what
it's like to live
on the outside

to not be in prison.

[ horns honking]

[ telephone ringing]

WOMAN:
Coming to bed, honey?

Yes, dear.

We've got to remind
her there is life
other than this.

Mrs. Puff,
if you come with us,

I'll stay after
school and decorate
the whole classroom!

For the last time, no!

I'm not going with you.

That's final!

[ calmly]:
Oh!

[ chuckles]

Talking to inanimate objects
again, eh, Puff?

Get back to your cell.

GUARD:
No more kitchen
time for you.

[ gasps]

Quick, Mrs. Puff,
hop on.

Guards! Guards!
Come quick!

There's a crazed
exstudent of mine

and his overweight
friend here
to break me out!

That's just
raw material

used to make
coat hangers.

You need some rest.

[ steam hisses]

Psst!

[ screams]

Hop in, Mrs. Puff.

Guards! Guards!
Come look.

Whoa!

They don't pay me enough
to do this job.

Mrs. Puff, up here!

[ gasps]:
Guards!

Guards! They're back!

What's all the hubbub,
Puff?

They're back!

BOTH:
Mrs. Puff, it's us!

[ sobbing]

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

What the barnacle
is going on?

Get away from me!

Get away!

What are you talking
about, Puff?

MRS. PUFF:
You can't fool me.

You're SpongeBob
and that guy who
likes the chili.

Let's face it, Puff,
you've gone off
the deep end.

Get in there, you!

You need a nice long stay
in solitary confinement!

Oh, well...

Let's look
at the positives again.

I'm finally away from those two.

Yes, all alone
in my nice soft room.

SPONGEBOB:
Made of sponge.

[ laughing]

[ SpongeBobs laughing]

[ all SpongeBobs laughing]

[ all SpongeBobs laughing]

[ screaming]

I can pass the test,
Mrs. Puff!

I can pass the test!

[ juice splashing]

[ moaning]

POLICE OFFICER:
Freeze!

Your joyride's over, punk!

[ screaming]:
No!

What?

SPONGEBOB:
No, no!

What are you doing?

Help! Help!

No! No! Please!

I have a snail
to feed.

I can't go to jail now.

This is not a good time.

No, please, please,
I'm not a criminal!

I can't believe it.

It was all a dream.

I'm not going to jail!

Why would you
go to jail?

You already did
your time.

[ screaming]

[ sirens blaring]

Huh?

Oh, it's just
my imagination again.

So what's for dinner
tonight, Puff Mama,
chili?

[ screaming]

[ gasping]

Aw, forget it.

Ah, observe the majesty 
of the mighty iceberg.

This frozen giant,

normally found 
floating in polar regions,

can sometimes stray 
into warmer waters,

causing dramatic changes 
in climate

for tropical undersea life.

[ wind whistles, roars]

Yes, it seems Old Man Winter

and he brought with him
not a pillow or a sheet

but a blanket...
a blanket of snow!

Yes, from Jellyfish Fields...

it's nothing
but the white stuff.

Whoopee!

And local residents
are taking notice.

Hey!

Drops of rain

I shall harness their energy

Aah... oh! Stop!

I wish to rule you!

Snow angel!

[ laughs giddily]

Oh...

Hey!

[ whistling innocently]

Thanks a lot, SpongeBob!

While you were just
standing there whistling,

someone threw a snowball at me!

Oh, really, Patrick?
[ giggles]

Did the snowball
look like this?

Yeah.

[ laughs]

This is serious,
SpongeBob.

Someone's after me.

I think I better
leave town.

Patrick, I threw it.

We're having
a snowball fight.

Don't you get it?

Snowball fight?

I want to play!
I want to play!

Well, first,
you have to make a snowball.

Oh, yeah! A snowball.

Ooh, this is going to be great!

Huh?

Wha...?

Aw...!

SpongeBob?

Can you help me
make a snowball?

Sure, pal.

Thanks, buddy.

Patrick!

How could you?!

It's a snowball fight, remember?

Oh, yeah.

[ both grunting and yelling]

Ah, yes...

Warm fire, cozy slippers,

and a piping hot cup of tea

Aah!

Why do I even bother?

[ scraping and thumping]

SQUIDWARD:
Would you two

please keep it down?!

Squidward! You're just in time
to enlist in my army!

Join me and together
we'll defeat the Pink Menace!

That's me!

You start off as a buck private,

but with hard work, perhaps
you can rise through the ranks

and become a regular private!

Thanks, but no, thanks,
Major Stupidity.

You and General Nonsense
over there will have
to fight without me.

[ snickers]

Got 'em both.

[ gasps]

[ growls]

Patrick, you fool!

This was over
before it started!

I will now consider your
unconditional surren...

Ooh.

[ gulps, gasps]

I was trying to tell you
that I was choking on snow,

but the snow melted
and turned into water

and I drank all the water;
now I'm better.

Fascinating.

Now, where was I?

[ knock at door]

What?

Can I use
your bathroom?

Patrick, go use
your own bathroom.

I won't make it.
Please?

No.

Please?

No.

Please?

No.

Please!

Make it quick.

That's okay.

SPONGEBOB:
Aha!

Aiding the enemy!

I caught you
Squidward!

Look, SpongeBob,
I was just...

SpongeBob! Oh!

[ shrieks]

Yay! Squidward's
on my side!

I most certainly
am not!

Then that means he's on my side!

No, SpongeBob, I'm not
on your side either!

I'm on nobody's side.

Snowball fights are
for immature children,

and I will not stoop
to your level.

If you two want to knock
each other's brains out
with snowballs,

kindly leave me out of it.

PATRICK:
SpongeBob, let's go knock
each other's brains out!

SPONGEBOB:
I'm ready!

Hmm.

Okay, Patrick, it's out.

[ snickers]

Now, there's something
I'd actually like to see.

Nothing wrong with getting
a frontrow seat, I suppose.

[ snickers]

Ah.

What's this?

Wha... I... No!

What are you doing?

You're supposed to be knocking
each other's brains out!

We signed a peace treaty,
Squidward.

You were right
fighting is for children.

No, no, I misled you,
it's for adults, too.

Give me
that peace treaty!

There! Let the war
continue.

Squidward,
that wasn't
the peace treaty.

That was a copy
of the peace treaty.

Look, you two are
giving up too easily.

Now, Patrick,
pretend I'm SpongeBob.

And who am I?

You're Patrick.

Can I be Mr. Krabs?

No! Wait, why?

He's a good leader.

Would you butt out?!

Hey, you can't talk
to Mr. Krabs

like that, Squidward!

I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!

Now, what are you
going to do?

Patrick, why didn't
you hit SpongeBob?

You said
you were SpongeBob.

[ imitating Mr. Krabs]:
It's true!

Now, get back to work!

[ laughs]

Oh, boy. All right,
I can see where
this is going.

Let's just say
for all intents and purposes

that I, Squidward, am now
part of this war. Now...

Where's your fort?

I don't have one, okay? Now...

You need a fort,
Squidward.

Forts win wars,
Squidward.

[ growls]

Okay, fine!
You want a fort?

There, there's
your fort! Now...

That fort's too small.

It's okay, Patrick.

It's just a demonstration.
Now...

He's right, Squidward.

That thing would
never protect you.

It's downright puny.

Trust me, it's fine!

SPONGEBOB:
See? It is too small.

Not if I crouch down!

You didn't let me
crouch down!

See? Down here,
I am perfectly...

Exposed.

Would you two
please...

stop throwing...

snowballs?!

[ growls]

[ gasps]

Squidward returned fire!

Then it's war!

No, no, wait, wait.

I was just giving
a demonstration!

[ growls]

All right, that's it!

You guys asked for it!

[ grunting]

I got him! Ha! I got him.

[ laughs]

In your face, SpongeBob!

[ laughs]

That was actually
kind of... exciting!

Why, I've never felt so alive!

[ laughs]

He got you good,
SpongeBob!

Ooh!

Take cover!

[ laughing]:
Take that! I got you!

Yeah, oh, I got you!

Oh, take that!

Whoa, I got you that time!

Oh, yeah.

[ laughing and grunting]

Incoming!

Hey, SpongeBob.

Yes, Patrick?

I think Squidward's
taking this really seriously.

That last one had
his clarinet in it!

Hmm, looks like
it's time for Plan B.

[ laughing wildly]

[ gasping and panting]

What's going on?

The snowballs
have stopped falling.

I better take advantage
of this momentary ceasefire.

What?! My left flank is exposed!

That bloated starfish is
going to run right through me!

I'll just fix that right now.

[ laughing]

Wait, that makes my north wall
a weak spot. Ha!

Here we go. Mmhmm, mmhmm.

Oh, oh, oh!

But if they attack
from the rear, I'm a goner.

There. Haha!
[ gasps]

But what about the possibility
of an aerial attack?

[ gasps]

[ laughing wildly]

I guess that ought to do it.

[ laughing wildly]

Fort Squidward is now
all but impenetrable!

[ laughing wildly]

Now, where are those fools?

[ grunts]

Ha! The first shot
has been fired!

[ grunts]

Take this, Patrick!

[ grunts]

Taste my frozen fury!

Victory is mine!

Whee!

I got you now!

[ Squidward laughing

Nope.

$1.50 for that?!

But it's an antique!

It belonged

Ten bucks.

Ten bucks?!

It's full of holes!

It was the queen of Switzerland.

A queen, you say? That's...

Wait a second,
they don't have a queen.

Okay,

Five bucks.

Pretty cool, huh?

That looks like
the toilet plunger
I threw out yesterday.

That ain't

This here's an antique!

It, uh... um... uh...
a 17thcentury soup ladle, see?

Man, was I using mine wrong.

How much?

Five bucks.

I've only got seven.

Deal!

Patrick Star,
you are one smart shopper.

Wow! Look at this neato
sodadrinking hat.

Oh! It must've belonged to
someone who was number one.

There's only been
a handful of number ones

in the entire history
of forever.

That's right, SpongeBob,
and you're one of 'em.

Really?

This hat says
"Hey, I'm number one

and I let gravity
do my drinking."

This hat was made
for you, boy.

You were born
to wear this hat!

Eee... ooh...!

A perfect fit,
eh, son?

Oh, thank you,
Mr. Krabs!

Thank you for
bringing us together!

[ sighs]
How can I ever repay you?

With ten dollars.

All I have is five.

Well, I guess
it's no deal.

I'll be right back.

[ gasps]

[ laughs]

Ah!

Mr. Krabs,
I found 68 cents.

But maybe you could
take the other $4.32

out of my paycheck.

What do you say?

Well... I don't know...

Uh... okay!

But only 'cause you look
so dashing in that hat.

Thanks, Mr. Krabs!

Don't mention it, boys!

[ laughs]

What a couple of rubes.

Excuse me, sir,
but are you

the purveyor
of this curio stand?

Yes, I am.

I understand
you're selling

this rare novelty drink hat.

Fresh out.

Let me explain.

I'm prepared to give you
$500 for that drink hat.

Fififififi...

Not so fast.

I'll give you $1,000
for such a hat.

[ stammers]

I'll give you

$100,000 in cash
for said hat.

[ stammers]

Sir, I'll give you
a million dollars for that hat!

SpongeBob!

[ laughs]

There he is
with me milliondollar hat.

I got to get it back

before he finds out
how much it's worth.

Ah! My bubble production
has increased twofold.

Thanks to you, Hatty.

SpongeBob!

Mr. K! How's the antique biz
treating you?

Never mind that.
Listen...

I didn't want to say this
in front of Patrick.

That hat makes you look
like a girl.

Am I a pretty girl?

Oh, well, um...

You're...
you're beautiful.

Uh... hehheh.

[ laughs]

All right, now give
me the hat back.

But, Mr. Krabs,
you said it yourself...

I was born
to wear this hat.

I don't want
to give it back.

I can't part
with this hat now.

Not after all
we've been through.

Thanks, Mr. Krabs!

I'll call you Hatty.

And that's
when you showed up.

Aw, forget it!

And you're not
beautiful either.

I'm not?

[ laughs]

SpongeBob, just the man
I wanted to see.

Still playing with
that dumb old hat, eh?

Yep.

Not sick of that
boring old hat yet?

Nope.

Not tired

of that old piece of junk?

Uhuh.

Not even a teensy, tiny bit?

Nope.

Then I guess

you don't want to see
what's in my bag.

What is it?

Novelty hats.

How about this
airconditioned one?

Seems a little dangerous.

The Juicer?

Ooh...

Foxy Grandpa?

[ laughs]

So, what do you say?

Your silly hat
for all these hats.

No deal, Mr. Krabs.

I'm sticking
with Hatty.

Thanks for the offer,
though.

I thought the Foxy Grandpa
would get him for sure.

I didn't want to have
to do this

but he leaves me
no other option.

I'm going to have to
scare it off of him.

[ snoring]

[ snickers]

This'll scare him.

[ scary moaning]

Oh, my gosh!

A floating shopping list!

[ screams]

I'm not a shopping list...

I'm a ghost...!

[ screams]

[ scary laughter]

Now, listen, SpongeBob.

How do you know my name?

Who are you?!

I am the Ghost
of Soda Drink Hats.

And I'm here to tell you

that that soda drink hat
you possess is cursed.

Cursed?

Yes! It once belonged
to some guy who's dead now.

What guy?

Uh... Smitty something.

Smitty what?

Uh, Smitty... Werben...

Jaegerman... Jensen.

He must have been number one.

Number one in Bogeyland!

Now, listen...

a curse will descend on you

unless the hat is returned
to its owner immediately.

Immediately?

Immediately...

To its owner?

Yes...

Right now?

Yes, yes!

It must be returned
to its owner right now!

Hey, Mr. Krabs.

Ahh! SpongeBob!

Uh, uh, what are you
doing here?

I was returning
the cursed soda drink hat

to its original owner:
Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.

What? There is
no Smitty Werben
Jaegerman Jensen.

Sure there is!

He's buried out
in Floater's Cemetery.

How did? I just...

You did... I would...

Give me that shovel!
[ muttering]

It was his hat Mr. Krabs.

He was number one!

[ bat squeaking]

[ eerie moaning]

[ hooting]

Huh?!

[ chattering]

[ gasps]

[ screeches]

Ahh!

Hold yourself together, Krabs.

It's just a boneyard...
filled with bones.

[ creaking]

Ahh!

What's that?

It's Squidward.

What's he doing here?

[ sniffles]

Ohh...

"Here lie Squidward's
hopes and dreams."

What a baby. Where was I?

Oh, yeah! Gotta find
Smitty Whatsajipster.

Nope... nope... no... no...

No... uhuh... no... no...
uhuh... nope, not there...

I've checked every headstone
in this cemetery

and there's no
Smitty Wabbablabba buried here.

Think, Krabs.

Maybe something SpongeBob said
will give you a clue.

Remember,
licking doorknobs

is illegal
on other planets.

No, not that!

You'll never guess

what I found in
my sock last night.

Go ahead, guess!

No! No! No! No! No!

It was his hat, Mr. Krabs.

He was number one!

Ahh! Barnacles!

I'll never find...

The grave!

Am I really going to defile
this grave for money?

Of course I am!

[ grunting]

[ thud]

Jackpot!

Ooh. It's beautiful.

Come to Papa.

Huh?

Come on, Smitty, let go.

Rest in pieces, Smitty.

I got the milliondollar hat!

[ thunder booms]

Hey, man, that's my hat.

Give it back.

What? No way.

Just crawl back
into your hole, bone boy.

Go ahead, play dead.

I guess I'm going to have
to take it from you.

Yeah, right. You and what army?

[ eerie groaning]

Only the army
of the living dead.

Oh, no! I've seen this
on the late show.

You ghoulish fiends hold me down

and take turns
nibbling on my innards.

Then you eat my brain and
leave my body for the buzzards.

That's disgusting.

We just want the hat back.

No flipping way!

Back up! Back up, I say!

Attack.

Tallyho!

Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!

You're falling apart,
marrow brain!

You must be kidding!

Back to oblivion!

Hupho! How's your sister?

All right, boneheads,
playtime's over.

Yeehoo!

[ yelling, swords clanging]

Waha!

A million dollars.

I've got a million dollars!

[ all talking at once]

Oh, there you are.

Well, I got it.

The rare novelty
soda drink hat.

Let's start the bidding
at $1 million.

[ all laughing]

Yeah, you want that
all at once?

A million
dollars!

You got to be
kidding!

[ laughter continues]

Hey! The poor sap's
not kidding.

Didn't you hear?

They found a whole
warehouse full of them.

They're worthless!

[ laughter continues]

Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand!

[ laughing]

Now, that's worth
a million dollars!

[ laughing]

Hey, kid, wait up!

I saw him first!

I'll give you
$1 billion!

Well, that's a spirit breaker.

[ crying]

What a baby.

[ sniffs]

Come on, Mr. Doodles

we haven't got all day.

We got to down
to me favorite restaurant

minewhere we're shooting
our first ever

Krusty Krab commercial.

After this commercial airs

we'll be swarming
with customers.

I can already feel myself
sweating money.

[ panting and barking]

No, I got Squidward
organizing the whole thing.

He's, you know... artsy.

What the...?

This looks expensive.

Out of my way.
Coming through.

Move it or lose it.

Squidward!

What?

What in the toons'
name is going on?

We're making the commercial,
Mr. Krabs.

What you're doing
is throwing away me money.

I told you to rent

only what's
absolutely necessary.

This is all necessary.

We'll, what's all
this useless junk?

That's the useless junk
for scene 28.

Oh, well, how do you
explain that?

A second Krusty Krab?

Mr. Krabs, everyone
needs an understudy.

Well, you got me there.

But why do we need him?

This job gets
very stressful, Mr. Krabs.

All right, get lost, all of you!

You're fired! Go on! Scram!
Get out of here, you moochers.

That's right, keep moving!

[ all grumbling]

Except you. You stay.

[ honks horn]

Well, this is just great.

Now we've got no crew
to make the commercial.

What are you talking
about, Squidward?

We got the cheapest
crew in the world.

You, me and Spongebob.

Speaking of which, where
is that little barnacle?

I'm down here, sir.

What are you doing, lad?

Squidward said I could help
by burying myself.

Quit fooling

and come on out.

I need you to be
in the commercial.

Me? In the Krusty Krab
commercial? Me?

Butbutbutbutbut...

Don't throw your buts
at me, Mr. Squidward.

We got a timetable
to keep.

This thing airs tonight.

Tonight?

Tonight?

Yep. I got a sweet deal

on a primetime slot.

SPONGEBOB: 
It's almost on, Gary.

[ yawns]

Yeah, I got butterflies, too.

This is the most exciting thing
to ever happen

in the history of history.

Look, Gary, it's on!

Oh, Jen, I've got
a real problem.

What's your problem, Amy?

I've got all this money

and I don't know
what to do with it

and I'm hungry.

[ hearty laughter]

Who's there?

Where's that
coming from?

BOTH:
Yippee! It's Mr. Krabs.

That's right, Amy.

I heard all about your little
problem and I'm here to help.

Follow me!

Where are we?Where are we?

Why, we're at none other than...

The Krusty Krab.

Did you say

Krusty Krab?

That's right.

Krusty Krab.

Home of the world famous...

Krabby Patty!

What's a Krabby Patty?

[ boinging]

Why, it's only the most
mouthwatering

appetizing food
in the seven seas.

There I am, Gary!

There I am!

We start with a fresh
pattygrilled and juicy.

Add some crisp undersea
veggies and cheese.

Topped off with secret sauce
and some buns.

Voila!A Krabby Patty.

I want a Krabby Patty.

Me, too.

How are you liking them
Krabby Patties, girls?

[ laughing]

Look, Gary,
there I am again. Look!

Two more satisfied customers.

So, why don't you come on in

and have yourself
a Krabby Patty today?

The Krusty Krab

Come spend your money here!

That was the best 60 seconds
of my life.

Well, time for bed.

[ rooster crows]

[ loud horn blowing]

Time to go do my favorite thing
at my favorite place.

[ humming]

Hey, you!

Top of the morning,
Oldster.

Hey, I saw you
on TV last night.

TV ANNOUNCER:
New Bran Flakes.

Bold new taste.

Bran Flakes.

You did?

Yeah, you were on
a commercial.

You're right.

Wow, he recognized me.

Yep. See you later, Bran Flakes.

What a nice cereal box.

Ah... "Weren't you
that guy on TV?"

"Yes, I am that guy.

How kind of you to notice."

"Weren't you that guy
on the television last night?"

[ laughs]

"Yes, that was me. I..."

Oh, please
excuse me, sir.

Oh, that's quite all right

uh... "Spongebob."

Wow. I'm getting
recognized all over.

Next thing you know

people are going to
start doing stuff

like holding doors
open for...

Why, sir, I'm flattered.

Really? I don't smell anything.

[ laughs]

You're on your way, kid.

[ humming]

Excuse me, sir.

Could I get a napkin?

Why, of course, dear sir.

And next time, feel free
to approach me.

It must be so degrading
to ask from across the room.

And who am I making
this bad boy out to?

To my tail fin.

I'll get it myself.

FIN. There we are, darling.

Mmm? Shyness got
the best of him.

There you are, Spongebob.

I need you to...

No problem, Squidward.

I got one
already made out.

Enjoy.

"To my tail fin."

Yes, I am that guy on TV.

Hey, look.

Please, good people,
no photos at work.

Here's the ketchup.

Well, maybe just one.

Another one?

Okay. Limbo.

[ humming]

And now theoh, I got it.

There you are,
Spongebob.

Jet pilot.

Now I need
you toow!

All right, boy.

Get in there and
scrub the head

and stop acting
so predictable.

So misunderstood.

Alas, good people, even the
brightest of stars grow weary.

And I am no
exception.

But I will shine again after
a quick break in my quarters.

Stay beautiful.

Hey, were you able to
catch Glandy McPinkfish

on Floundermanlast night?

No, how was he?

Well, I new this guy's
acting was good

but his singing
is phenomenal.

I'm tell you, Vender

if that guy was to cut
a solo record

it would be a hit.

Solo record.

So, if I fire him and make his
successor do twice the work...

[ knock on door]

Uh, come in.

Oh, it's just you, Spongebob.

Those heads better be beautiful.

They are, Mr. Krabs,
and so is mine.

And now I got to lay something
on you, Krabs baby.

The only thing
you better lay

is some patties on
the grill, fry boy.

I can't take
that gig, Krabber.

That phase of my career is over.

I'm an entertainer now.

What in blazes
are you talking about?

Come on, Krabs, let's think
outside the box for a second.

Commercials are old hat.

The people want music.

If I could change fate,
I would, Krabsie.

But I'm an entertainer
deep downa people's person.

We're on the same page here,
aren't we?

Boy, those krabby fumes
must have got to your head.

Borrow Squidward's gas mask
then get right back to work.

I knew you'd understand.

Well, thanks for the start.

I'm out of here.

[ clicking fingers]

Ooh... I've never felt
such a strange combination

of pity and indigestion.

There he is.

Hey, we've been
waiting for you.

Where have you been?

How long are you going
to keep us standing here?

Well, Spongebob, are you
just going to stand there

like a halfwit, mouth agape

or are you going to fill
these people's orders?

Pipe down, Squidward.

This crowd looks angry.

They're not going
to wait any longer.

I think I better give them
what they need and fast.

I think so, too

or Krabs will
fire both of us.

On second thought,
keep them waiting.

No can do, Squidward.

These people demand
entertainment.

Enter what?

How you doing, folks?

ALL:Hungry!

That's no problem,
ladies and germs

'cause Spongebob is here

to satisfy.

Hey.

Eating here was your idea.

I'd like to call this little
number "Striped Sweater."

The best time to wear
a striped sweater

Is all the time

One with a collar,
turtleneck

That's the kind

'Cause when
you're wearing...

We're starving!

[ crowd yelling]

That one...
special sweater...

[ all yelling]

Squidward, this crowd
is insatiable.

Then why don't you
get back in the kitchen

and grab some patties,
and give them

what they came here for!

Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy.

Boo!

Is this some kind of joke?

They want juggling and jokes
at the same time?

Tough crowd.

Oh, now what's he doing?

Uh, what do you call a vampire
whose car breaks down

three miles from a blood bank?

A cab.

We're losing our appetites!

Uh, okay, there's a nun,
an astronaut, and a hairdryer.

ALL:
We want patties!

Well, the most I can juggle
is three.

But the show must go on.

Whoa!

Boo!

Boo!

[ screams]

My career is over.

All those years 
clawing my way up.

All the people 
I've stepped on, wasted.

Hey, finally.

That's what we've been
waiting for.

They seem to like it when
I put this patty on the grill.

I may be able
to save this act yet.

Roll with it, Spongebob,
roll with it.

There's more where
that came from, folks.

[ cheers]

You like that?

It's what we wanted
all along.

It's working, but how do I 
follow it up?

Think on your feet, Spongebob.

That's what got you this far. 
Buns!

It's a stretch

but we all got to try

to push the envelope sometime.

Okay, folks,
how do you like this?

I'm breaking new ground.

Time to get edgy.

CROWD:
We want onions!

Cheese!

[ cheers]

Ready for the grand finale?

[ cheers]

Whoopee!

Krabby Patties!

[ cheers]

Well, Spongebob, looks like

you finally found your calling.

I'll say.

I'm so glad I gave up
fry cooking for this.

Closing time 
at The Krusty Krab.

51, 52, 53...

29, 30, 31...

One, two, three,
one, two, three...

Mr. Krabs, can
we please go now?

Perhaps one of our
more loyal workers

can enlighten you
on company policy.

The Krusty Krab
Employee Manual
Second Revised Edition

page 35, section 19,
clause 3a states

"All staff must remain
on the premises

until the day's receipts
are fully accounted for."

But that's not fair.

Clause 3b:
"The proprietor reserves
the right to be unfair."

Teacher's pet.

Let's see...

five, ten, 25,
blue, applesauce...

Everything looks to be in order.

Except...

Where is it?

Where is it?!
What?

My dime.
Me special dime.

The first dime
I ever made.

I always keep it
at the back of the
register for luck.

Well, I've never seen it.

Hmm.

Are you prepared to say that
with your hand on a stack

of Interpretive Dance 
Quarterlies?

Of course I...

What are you saying?

Me? I ain't saying nothing
that would matter to anyone

who'd be willing to take
a lie detector test.

You're saying something.

Heavens to Betsy, no.

It's just that me lucky dime's
gone missing

and you've been working
the register all day.

Are you accusing me
of something?

Well, the way I see it,
there are three possibilities.

Oneyou stole it.

Twoyou stole it.

Or threeyou stole it!

I didn't take
your precious dime.

Show me your tentacles.

What?
I want to see
empty suction cups.

Here, here, here.
See them?

You... you can't do that to me.

I'm your boss!

Not anymore, Mr. Krabs.

I quit.

[ cries]:
No.

I'm out of here.

Squidward, you're making
a big mistake.

Mistake? Ha!

The only mistake
I ever made

was wasting my life
at The Krusty Krab.

But a visit to The Krusty Krab
makes everyone happy.

And what could be better
than serving up smiles?

Being dead or anything else.

I never knew you felt
so strongly about this.

Where have you been?

Well, I guess
I can't stop you.

But, Squidward,
it's a cold, cold
world out there.

No one's going to
serve you happiness
on a silver platter.

Free sample?Cookies!

Can I have...?

Anyway, I just
want you to know

if you ever get in
trouble, come find me.

I'll take care of you.

'Cause you and me?

We're like brothers.

Only closer.

[ beating]

[ screams]

Spongebob, I don't need
your help.

I am ready to unlock
my potential.

I can become anything
I set my mind to.

I could be a football player...

or a king...

or a spaceman.

Or a football playing
king in space...

with a mustache.

[ monotone]:
Yeah. Uhhuh.

You know, that reminds me

there's something I've been
wanting to say to you

since the day we met.

Goodbye.

Next time you see me

this town will be eating
out of the palm of my hand.

Spare change?

Spare change, ma'am?

Squidward?

Squidward, is that you?

Uh, I... uh...

It's me, Spongebob.

We used to work together.

Spongebob?

There you go.

So where you living
these days?

Squidward
Tentacles?
Yes?

Sign here
please.

Uh... nowhere.

Great, and what have you
been doing with yourself?

No, wait, let me guess.

I see you've been working
on that mustache.

The tattered clothes...

the awful smell...

You're a football player!No.

A spaceman.

No.

A football playing
king in space?

Don't you get it?!

I'm a loser!

I've lost my job,
my home...

everything!

[ gasps]:
Even your paintings?

Nobody would take them,
so I had to eat them.

[ crying]

There, there...

you can come live with me.

Here you go, Squidward.

You sleep in my bed.

Okay, but just
till I get a job.

One day, two days tops.

Nonsense, you stay as
long as you need to.

Good night, my little angel.

Breakfast is ready.

You'll need to build up
your strength again

so I laid out a big
buffet for you.

And in bed, too?

Oh, thanks, Spongebob.

Spongebob, I...Ah, shh, shh, shh.

Here comes the plane.

[ buzzing]

It's really nice of you
to help me in my time of need.

I'll try not to be a burden.

It's no trouble.

Is there anything else
I can do for you... winner?

No, no, no, you've already...

well...

Oh, wow.

Nourishing a broken spirit
is a lot of work.

I'm bushed.

Still, it feels nice to do good.

[ yawns]: 
Good night, Gary.

SQUIDWARD: 
Spongebob

can I get a glass of water?

[ footsteps]

Thank you.

Good night.

[ footsteps]

Spongebob, can I get 
some more blankets?

[ footsteps]

Here you go.

Thank you.

[ footsteps]

Spongebob, you forgot 
to turn out the light.

[ footsteps]

Good night.

[ yells, thudding]

[ meows]

[ gasps]:
Gary.

Squidward is not
a freeloader.

And he would never
take advantage of me.

He's just having a hard time
getting his confidence back.

I'm sure he's close
to a breakthrough.

[ grunting]

[ meowing]

I know he still isn't
looking for work!

Don't rub it in!

Spongebob,
where's my lemonade?

Coming, Squidward.

Spongebob!

Spongebob!

And why aren't you
in uniform?

It's about time you got here.

Here you go,
your majesty.

I can't drink that.

Why not?

Are you blind?
Just look at it.

What about it?

That lemon has
three seeds in it.

That's an odd number!

I can't eat anything
odd numbered.

Fine, I'll just
take it out.

No! No!

It's already contaminated
by the bad lemon.

It won't work.

Hmm. That's two things in
this house that won't work.

Then go fix them.

Two things
that won't work.

I've changed my mind.
I want soup instead.

Okay.

Don't move.

Here you go.

It's alphabet soup.
I made it special.

Ah! Condensed soup
from a can.

Disgusting.

Now you've ruined
my appetite.

Go fetch me
something to read.

Oh, okay.

How about this?

[ gasps]

Get that away from me.

You know I'm allergic
to newsprint.

You know, when you
swatted that newspaper
out of my hands

it reminded me of something
a friend of mine did...

at his job!

[ deep bass horn blows]

4:00. Time for my stories.

Hurry up, they won't hold
the show while you laze around.

[ whistling]

Hey, where you going?

To my job.

You have a job?

Why wouldn't I?

I'm not some lazy,
inconsiderate jerk

who lays in bed all day.

Say, where can I get
one of these jobs?

Oh, they're everywhere.

Especially if you're green
and have six tentacles.

Thanks, I'm going to go
look for one so I can stop

moochingoff my friends

and they can get back
to their lives.

This isn't my show.

Spongebob, the remote
control's broken.

Get over here and fix it.

I've got a better idea.

Why don't I call someone
whose jobit is to fix it?

You know why?

Because when
I need a jobdone

I get someone with
a jobto do that job!

What are you saying?

[ screaming]

Donate to the children's fund?

Why? What have children
ever done for me?

You want your dime back?

Take it.

Now Squidward
can come back, right?

Wrong. That ain't
my first dime.

Then have some more dimes.
I've got plenty of them.

You can't put a price
on me first dime.

And I can't forgive

that thieving bilge rat
Squidward for stealing it.

Listen you crustaceous
cheapskate!

Squidward's been
living at my house
driving me crazy!

And you're not going
to hire him back

all because of
a stupid dime?!

What's that?

[ gasps]

Me first dime.

Oh, dimey! I'll never
lose you again.

This is a dime?

I've been in business
a long time, boy.

So... if Squidward
never stole the dime

he can come back
to work, right?

Aye, lad.

Just let the dime and me
have our privacy.

Eee hoohoo!

Well, Mr. Squidward,
it's good to have you back.

Well, it's kind of good
to be back, sir.

It's all water under
the bridge now.

I agree, sir.

After all,
I'm sure you didn't mean
to misplace me dime.

What? What are you saying?

Well, it's obvious that you
put the dime in me pants.

Dimes just don't fly
into people's pants.

Are you accusing me
of something?

Well, the way I see it

there are three
possibilities.

Oneyou put the dime
in me pants.

Twoyou put the dime 
in me pants.

Or threeyou put the dime 
in me pants!

NARRATOR:
Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious
oasis of sand and sea.

SANDY: 
Shoot,SpongeBob,

how can we
go swimming

when you're
in a shirt & tie?

Ah, yes, how foolish of me.

[ cackles]

Allow me to remedy
said situation right now.

I will just use
this changing tent here

to change into my bathing suit.

And I won't do anything else.

SpongeBob's acting jumpier

than a rattlesnake
in a pickle barrel.

Wait... what?

[ laughing]

Oh, I'll be changing all right,

but not into a bathing suit.

Wait until Sandy sees
that I brought my karate gear!

Hiyah!

Hi... yah!

Sandy won't beat me this time,

because I've got the element
on my side.

The element of surprise.

Hiyah!

SANDY:
SpongeBob,
are you ready?

Yes, Sandy,
I most certainly am ready!

[ softly]:
Ready to get it on.

Hi...

Hiyah!

Look, SpongeBob,

we both brought our karate gear.

[ muffled laughing]

Great minds
think alike, I suppose.

Hiyah!

I may be down, but I'm not out!

Way to go, buddy.

It took us
three days

to make that
potato salad.

Three days!

Hiyah!

Sandy?

[ muffled]:
Oh, I'm Sandy all right...

I'm very sandy.

Hiyah!

Oh, I get it.

She's "Sandy."

That's her name and she's
also covered in... yes.

Excuse me for a sec.

Hi... yah!

No, no, thank you.

everyone

Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line
to get into the Salty Spitoon,

the roughest,
toughest,
sailor club

ever to be built
under the seven seas.

Only the baddest of the bad
can get in.

You need to have muscles.

[ muscles popping]

You need to have muscles
on your muscles.

[ popping]

You need to have muscles
on your eyeballs.

[ straining]

Ew.

[ creature screaming]

[ loud thud]

Looks like a ripsnortin'
good time, SpongeBob.

Yeah, let's go in.

Go ahead.

Welcome to
the Salty Spitoon.

How tough are ya?

How tough am I?

How tough am I?

I had a bowl of nails
for breakfast this morning.

Yeah, so?

Without any milk.

Uh, right this way.

Sorry to keep
you waiting.

Welcome to

How tough are ya?

How tough am I?

SPONGEBOB:
Wow.

Got any more

Uh, that won't

Go ahead.

Thanks!

You got a new bottle
of ketchup?

Sure.

It's on!

[ straining]

[ panting]

[ straining and shouting]

If I could just run this
under some hot water...

Get outta here.

This place is too tough
for you, little man.

Too tough for me?

That's downright ridiculous.

I'll have you know
I stubbed my toe last week

while watering my spice garden
and I only cried for 20 minutes.

Listen, kid, I think
you'd be more comfortable

over at that place.

SPONGEBOB:
Weenie Hut Jr.'s?

Are you saying I belong
at Weenie Hut Jr.'s?

Oh, no, sorry.
I was actually

pointing to the place
next to it.

SPONGEBOB:
Super Weenie Hut Jr.'s?

Yeah.

Unless you think you're
tough enough to fight me.

How's your collection

Well I don't

but it's

I'm in the process
of acquiring issue 347

which will give me
my fourth set.

No!

[ snorts]:
What weenies.

Oh, brother.

[ robotic voice]:
Would you care
for another diet cola

with a lemon twist,
Weenie?

What?!

But I'm not a weenie!

[ machinery whirring]

I'm sorry, sir,
but my sensors indicate

that you are
indeed a weenie.

[ computer beeps]

That's impossible!

You can't hide
what's inside.

[ panting]

I demand entrance
into your club

on the grounds
that I am nota weenie!

Hey, Reg,
how's it going?

You were saying?

Go ahead, buddy.

Thanks, Reg.

So, your name's Reg?

Would you get outta here?

Mark my words, Reg!

I will get into
the Salty Spitoon!

I will!

FISH:
Couldn't
get in, huh?

What you need is
a tough hairdo.

No one gets
into the doubleS

without a tough
hairdo.

I disagree
I saw a guy

going in there
and he was bald.

I saw that guy.

He wasn't bald,
he had a shaved head.

Shaved
that's a hairdo.

Case closed.

Hey, where'd he go?

I believe
he said something

about going to
the wig store.

Haha!

Check and mate!

What's shaking,
my man?

Not much.

Say, haven't I seen you before?

Doubt itI'm a drifter
just blew into town.

Heard your club
was pretty tough.

Thought I'd check it out.

Nice try, kid.

I know it's you.

What are you
talking about?

Aha!

Hey everybody,
what's going on?

Ah, you can go in.

Sorry about that.

And what do youwant?

I'd like to gain entrance
to your club, please.

I believe my hairdo is in order.

[ laughs nervously]

So where do you stand

on the whole
bald vs. shaved debate?

Heyya, Reg.

All right,
now it's a party.

Oh, yeah, check out
the new ink.

Thanks.

Hey, look what I can make it do.

[ chuckling]:
Yeah!

Hey, what about
that one?

Huh, you know, I don't
remember getting this one.

Can you make it
dance?

Oh, here, let me try.

Hotcha, chacha,
hotcha, chacha.

Chaditty

Hmm, wait a minute.

Go ahead in.

Yeah, sure, Reg.

Thanks.

Nice try, little man.

Hey, I was in front of you!

No, you weren't!

Are you callin' me a liar?

I ain't callin' you
for dinner!

[ grunting and shouting]

[ SpongeBob screaming]

[ grunting and shouting]

Hold it, you two
that's enough.

You're both
plenty tough.

Go ahead in.

All right.

Thanks, Reg.

Hey, what about me?

I was in that scrap.

[ chortles]:
I saw you running.

When you get
in a real fight,
then we'll talk.

Well then, I guess it's time
to take it up a notch.

[ punches whooshing]

I am not a weenie!

Relax, you're

My friends don't hang out
at Weenie Hut Jr.'s.

You tell 'em,
SpongeBob.

Patrick, what are
you doing here?

I'm always here on
DoubleWeenie Wednesday.

Actually,
they moved

DoubleWeenie

Besides,today'sMonday.

Oh, so it's

Barnacles!

Super Weenie
Hut Jr.'s

Weenie
Monday.

No, you're
thinking

of Monster
Weenie Monday.

I don't have time for this!

I've gotta go pick a fight
with a muscular stranger.

It's the only way of getting

into the Salty Spitoon.

No, SpongeBob,
you can't.

It's too dangerous.

I've got no choice.

I have a suggestion.

Why not fake a fight?

Hey, that's not
a bad idea!

You can call me
a couple of bad names,

we rumble,
next thing you know

you're in
the Salty Spitoon.

Well, I guess I've
got nothing to lose.

Let's do it!

Yeah!

Hey, how come
you never

help us with
our problems?

I am a robot,
not a miracle worker.

Afternoon, Reg.

Whoa, whoa, little man.

You still can't go in.

Well, that makes me
pretty mad.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

I might have to beat someone up

just to get rid
of all this blind fury.

[ sarcastically]:
Wow.

I feel pretty sorry for the
next guy who looks at me funny.

Hmm... what about
that guy?

[ gasping and 
stammering]

I...[ laughing]
don't be silly,

he's not bothering
anybody.

I mean, not like...
that guy!

Who, me?

Yeah, you.

Standing there all
smiling and whatnot.

Somebody ought to teach
you some manners.

Okay, but I must
warn you.

I happen to be a world
championship... uh...

"kick... box... er."

I don't care if you're
the demon seed
of Davey Jones!

You're going down, Tubby!

Tubby?

[ growling]

Nobody calls me Tubby!

Wait, Patrick.

You're supposed to
let mewin, remember?

Oh, yeah.

[ invisible punches flying]

No, please wait!

[ grunting]

[ screaming]

No, please, have mercy.

[ screaming]

REG:
Wow!

You destroyed
that guy

without even
touching him!

I did?

I never thought
I'd say this,

but...
go ahead in.

Really?

I can go in?

Oh, my gosh, I never thought
this moment would come!

I, SpongeBob SquarePants,

am tough enough to get
into the Salty Spitoon!

This is the happiest day
of my life!

[ siren wailing]

Sandy?

[ groans]

What happened?

You ran inside and
slipped on an ice cube.

What happened?

I slipped on an ice cube
and got covered in booboos.

Booboos, eh?

I think you guys
want thathospital.

SPONGEBOB:
Weenie Hut General?!

SQUIDWARD:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,

three, two, one.

I'm done with my shift,
Mr. Krabs!

And let me just say,

there will come a day when I
will make something of my life

and I will never have to set
foot in this grease trap again!

KRABS:
Yeah, we'll see you

after your lunch break,
Squidward.

Okay.

CREATURE:
So I just took
my private yacht

across my private lake
to my private heliport.

It's the only way
off my private island.

Oh, shrimp!

It's my arch rival from high
school, Squilliam Fancyson!

I can't let him see me
in my Krusty Krab uniform.

On your lunch break,
eh, Squiddy?

Yes... I mean no...
I mean... uh, uh...

Hey, whatcha
been up to?

Oh, just succeeding in
everything you've failed in.

You are no great shakes,
Squilliam Fancyson!

Anyone can be a big shot in
a hick town like Bikini Bottom.

Oh, is that so?

Let's hear what you've
accomplished

since high school, Squiddy.

[ thinking]: 
Don't be intimidated, 
Squidward.

Try to imagine him 
in his underwear.

Oh, no, he's hot!

I'm, uh, in... food service.

Hold it,
don't tell me

you're a cashier!

[ all laughing]

[ thinking]: 
Don't lie.

Lying always makes it worse.

I own a fivestar restaurant!

Squidward, I had no idea
you were such a success.

That's right!

And I would be honored

if you would allow me
to come to yourrestaurant...

tonight.

[ glass breaks]

Tttttttonight?

In fact, we'll all come.

My treat!

[ cheering]

SQUIDWARD:
Please, Mr. Krabs,
you got to help me!

When they get here
tonight

they'll see I'm just
a big phony and a loser!

Oh, boohoo!

Let me play a sad song for you
on the world's smallest violin.

This is serious.

I know
this really is

the world's
smallest violin.

See?

Mr. Krabs!

Please let me run
the restaurant

for just one night!

I really need
to impress Squilliam.

SqSqSqSquilliam?

That guy who
made millions

doing what you
wish you could do?

Don't rub it in.

Why didn't you
tell me?

We'll take him
to the cleaners!

All right,
listen up!

Men, Squilliam Fancyson
will be here in 20 minutes.

Therefore, we need
to turn the Krusty Krab

into a fancy restaurant
as soon as possible!

Patrick, what are you
doing here?

I thought the Corps

would straighten out
my life, sir!

The Corps?

What the...?

Patrick this isn't the...

[ sighing]:
Beggars can't
be choosers.

Can you take hats

in a dignified and
sophisticated manner?

You mean like
a weenie?

Okay!

May I take
your hat, sir?

May I take
your hat, sir?

May I...

All right,
I've heard enough.

You've got the job.

Mr. Krabs, didn't you once
serve on the S.S. Gourmet?

Ayeaye!

Then you'll be
our chef.

What can I do?

I can't believe
I'm saying this,

but, SpongeBob, you're going
to have to be the waiter.

What's that?

It's the guy who goes
to tables and takes orders.

Do other restaurants
do that?

Yes, they do that!

Now listen,
Squilliam is on his way

and you have
less than 20 minutes

to become
a fancy waiter,

so read this.

" How To Become a Fancy Waiter

in Less Than 20 Minutes."

Don't worry,
Squidward,

I'll memorize
every page

right down to
the punctuation!

All right, I've got
all the positions filled.

I just might pull this off.

PATRICK:
Give me that hat!

I said give it to me!

Are you going to
hand it over or not?

Don't you backsass me!

[ grunting]

He's just the hatcheck guy,
nothing essential!

[ explosion]

What happened?
What is it?

Peas!

KRABS:
Made 'em the
oldfashioned way.

Mr. Krabs, you got
to take them out of the...

[ gasps]:
Holy fish paste, what is that?

That's the appetizer!

But, I thought you said

you were the head chef
on the S.S. Gourmet?

Did I say that?

No, I cleaned
the bathrooms
on the Gourmet.

I was the head chef
on the S.S. Diarrhea.

There you are!

SpongeBob, you got to help me!

Patrick and Mr. Krabs
aren't working out

and Squilliam's
almost here,

and, and... SpongeBob?

I can't do it.

I can't do it, Squidward.

What?

Every sentence,
every paragraph

Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper!

Don't you understand?

My brain is full to bursting!

If I have to memorize
a single order,

I think I'm going
to explode!

SpongeBob, hold on!

Let's just take a second here
to relax.

Little more...

Little more...

Good.

Now... I want you
to empty your mind.

Empty my mind?

Empty your mind.

Empty my mind.

Empty your mind of everything

that doesn't have to do
with fine dining.

Fine dining
and breathing...

Just got an order
from the boss:

dump everything that
isn't about fine dining!

ALL:
Everything?

Everything.

Come on, come on!

Quicker, quicker!

[ panicked shouting]

Start dumping,
start dumping.

Come on, let's get moving!

Hurry up!

What am I paying you for?

You don't pay me.

We don't even exist.

We're just a clever
visual metaphor

used to personify
the abstract concept
of thought.

One more crack like that
and you're out of here!

No, please!

I have three kids!

[ panicked shouting]

[ flushing]

[ panicked shouting]

How do you feel?

SpongeBob?

[ snapping tentacles]

This isn't working!

I gotta go tell Squilliam
I need more time!

I'll just go and tell him...

You're here!

Hello, Squiddy!

We're all ready
to be dazzled

by your fivestar
restaurant.

Wait, Squilliam!

I've got to explain!

Explain what?

That you,
Squidward Tentacles,

voted most likely
to suck eggs
n high school,

are trying to pass off
a lousy burger stand

as a fivestar...

[ gulping]

...restaurant?

Hommina, hommina,
hommina, hommina...

BOTH:
Hommina, hommina, hommina...

ALL:
Hommina, hommina, hommina,
hommina, hommina...

Table for Hommina?

I can seat you
immediately.

[ whispering]:
How did you do all this?

It was easyonce
I cleared my mind.

But what about
Krabs and Patrick?

Taken care of.

[ moaning]

Right this way,
please.

Good evening, sir.

From our menu tonight,

might I recommend
the Krabby Newburg?

We take the finest cuts
of aged, imported kelp,

stuff them with herbs
from our garden,

wrap them in parchment

with our
shallot tapenade,

roast them for hours
in our woodfired oven,

and serve them
with wilted coral

on a mahogany plank.

Mmm... this is
fantastic!

Thank you, sir.

Pinch me, I must be dreaming.

[ screams]

If you need
anything else,
just call.

SpongeBob, I can't
thank you enough

for all
you're doing!

Fine dining and breathing
are all I know how to do.

[ inhaling]

It worked.

I can't believe it!

Squilliam thinks I own
a fivestar restaurant.

Time to rub it in his face.

[ sighing]

Well, Squilliam,
I'm waiting.

All right, I admit it.

Everything is fabulous!

The food, the atmosphere
everything's flawless!

In that case,
I need you to read this.

"Squidward Tentacles..."

And I need you
to wear this.

Oh, eh, "Squidward Tentacles
has the fanciest..."

I'm sorry,
one more time.

"Squidward Tentacles has
the fanciest restaurant

in Bikini Bottom...
and he does not suck eggs."

[ cheering]

Squidward,
I must tell you...

Thank you.

What really won me over
was your brilliant waiter.

It's as if
all he knows

is fine dining
and breathing.

I must know
your name.

[ record scratching]

My name?

Yes, your name,
son.

Uh, Beef Wellington?

No, your name.

Uh... er...

The fork on the left?

Stop joking.

Tell him
our name.

My name...

What's his name?
What's his name?

I got nothing on a name!

Come on baby, what's the name?

[ panicked shouting]

We threw out his name!

[ screaming]

Uh...

[ barking]

I am so
very sorry!

I don't know what
has gotten into that...

[ screaming]

More soup for
your armpits?

[ screaming]

Please enjoy
the food!

Would you like some cheese
on that, sir?

Ow, ow, ow, ow!

[ panicked screaming]

No, no!

[ screaming]

Run for your lives, everyone,
it's the appetizer!

[ roaring]

[ screaming]

[ glass breaks]

[ cloth tears]

Well, Squiddy,
I'm waiting.

Okay, I admit it!

I'm a fraud!

This was all a futile,
pathetic attempt
to impress you.

This isn't really
my restaurant!

I'm just a cashier!

Squidward, I understand.

I have a confession
to make myself.

I made everything up
about my life.

I have no yachts,
jets or anything.

I was only trying
to impress you.

The horrible, sad truth is
I'm a cashier, too!

[ sobbing]

[ violin playing]

Is that true?

Of course not!

I'm filthy,
stinking rich!

Come on, everyone!

Let's all take a ride
in my balloon/casino.

CROWD:
Hooray!

[ tearing]

[ sighs]

[ groans]

I got such
a headache.

What's going on

Oh, the usual.

I keep thinking robots

the world.

I even asked Gary
if he was a robot.

he feels "recharged."

KRABS:
Beebeeboo, booboobop?

Beebooboobop?

Booboobeebop?

Not "Beebooboobeep"?

Bop?

Beep?!

Booboobop?!

[ screaming]

[ teeth chattering]

Oh, my gosh!

Why was Mr. Krabs making
all those beeping sounds?

Could it be that he's a robot?

Nah.

[ gasps]

[ technopop song playing]

Oh, Squidward,
it's terrible!

Mr. Krabs...
talking to radio...

beeping sounds...
strange dancing...

robot!

That's great,
SpongeBob.

Why don't you work
on this problem back
in the kitchen!

[ chuckling]

I'm serious, Squidward.

Mr. Krabs is a robot.

And I can prove it, too!

How did you...?

Let's seein the movie,

the robots didn't have
a sense of humor;

they couldn't laugh.

Hey, Mr. Krabs!

What is it,
boy?

Squidward just told me
a hilarious joke

and I thought you
might like to hear it.

Is it true, Squidward?

Is it hilarious?

Um... yeah, sure.

Well, let's
hear it, lad.

Okay, here it goes.

Uh, how'd it go, Squidward?

[ chuckling 
nervously]

It went... um, uh,
let's see, uh...

Why couldn't the 11yearold
get into the pirate movie?

Why?

It was rated "Arr!"

[ laughing]

Arr!

[ laughing]

Because it's...
about... pirates.

I'm not paying you to do
standup, Mr. Squidward.

Now, get back
to work.

[ gasps]

Not even a chuckle!

See, Squidward?

He didn't laugh because
he couldn't laugh

because he's a robot!

There's a logical explanation
why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob.

He's obviously heard it before.

The only reason
you think Krabs
is a robot

is because you watched
that stupid movie.

Now, why
don't you...

Hey, Mr. Krabs!

What?
What is it, boy?

Squidward's father
never hugged him.

Isn't that sad?

[ crying]

Yes, I suppose
that is rather sad.

But Squidward
can hug himself
during his break.

Now, get back
to work.

Just like the robot in the
moviehe couldn't cry either.

SpongeBob,
this is getting ridiculous.

I'll have you know
my father loved me very much!

That's the final test,
Squidwardthe love test.

Robots can't love.

Now, wait,
SpongeBob...

Hey, Mr. Krabs!

What is it,
SpongeBob?

I just wanted to tell you
that Squidward loves you!

Get back to work,
Mr. Squidward.

[ gulping]

Squidward?

[ technopop song playing]

[ music slows, then stops]

[ radio crackling]

Aw, me radio died.

Mmm... these batteries still
have a little juice in them.

I knowI'll give them
to Pearl for Christmas.

[ timer dings]

Me hardboiled egg is ready!

I can already taste it.

Come to Papa!

Gotcha!

And what good is a hardboiled
egg without a little salt?

SPONGEBOB:
Mr. Krabs!

[ screaming]

Oh, my eyes! Aah!

Mister...

Will you be quiet?

What did these robots
in the movie look like?

They had piercing red eyes,
metal pincers for hands

and they ran on batteries.

Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs
look anything like that?!

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

[ both screaming]

[ Krabs screaming]

I'll evacuate
the customers,
you call the Navy.

Hello, operator,
get me the Navy.

[ recorded voice]:
Hello, you've reached the Navy's
automated phone service.

Squidward, the robots
are running the Navy!

Not the Navy!

[ over loudspeaker]:
Everyone, run for your lives!

Robots have taken over
the world!

Our world!

[ all screaming]

What do we do now?

I don't know.

Hey, a nickel!

SpongeBob!

Sorry.

Ah, that's better.

Bee, booboobeeboop,
booboobop...

We need to find out

what that robot did with
the real Mr. Krabs, but how?

Well, in the movie the hero
teams up with a buddy

and they get the poop
on the robot.

They poop on the robot?

Yeah, you know, they get
the straight poop,

ask questions, get information.

I never thought I'd say this,

but, SpongeBob,
let's get that poop!

[ door opens]

Oh, hello, boys.

What can I do for you?

[ lock clicks]

Why did you lock the door?

Why do you have that rope?

Who's watching
the cash register?!

[ all shouting, loud crashing]

SpongeBob! Squidward!

What's the meaning of this?

Untie me this instant!

Shut up.

[ loud smack]

Sweet Davy Jones!

What the heck is going on?

I said shut up,
you bucket of bolts!

I can't take it!

[ crying]

SpongeBob,
are you okay?

[ crying]:
Oh, Squidward, seeing you
slap Mr. Krabs like that

is just too horrible
to watch.

No, that's
not Mr. Krabs.

That's Robot Krabs.

Oh, yeah.

And the only way
to deal with these
robot types

is to find out
what they know.

Right.

SpongeBob, you
got to ask him
a question first.

Oh, yeah.

What color is
my underwear?

SpongeBob,

let me handle this.

Where's Mr. Krabs?

What are you talking about?

I'm Mr. Krabs.

We can do this
all night if
you want.

Where's Mr. Krabs?

I'm Mr. Krabs.

Where's Mr. Krabs?

I'm Mr. Krabs.

Where's Mr. Krabs?

I am Mr. Krabs!

I am! I am! I am! I am!
I am! I am! I am!

This is one stubborn robot.

What?!

You think I'm a robot?!

We don't think;
we know.

That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

I am Mr. Krabs!

He's not cracking.

We'll never get it
out of him this way.

I got an idea.

Keep an eye on him,
Squidward.

Don't fall for any
of his robotricks.

[ clanging]

If Robot Krabs won't tell us
where Mr. Krabs is,

maybe one of his
little robot friends will.

SpongeBob, uh,
that's a blender.

Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs
talking with his radio before.

He called it his
"little buddy."

Oh, really?

Put it on the table,
SpongeBob.

You're going
to interrogate
my blender?

You're crazy!

We're just going
to see what your
"little buddy" knows.

No, wait!

What are you going to do
to me blender?!

That cost me money!

Where's Mr. Krabs?

Not talking, eh?

No! That cost me $24.95!

I guess it didn't
know anything.

Go get the toaster.

No, not me toaster.

That cost me $32.50!

$62.67!

Fort...

Well, actually,
that one was a gift.

No!

This is the last robot,
Squidward.

No! Not my cash register!

I raised it myself!

I got it when it was
just a little calculator.

No!

[ crying]

[ crying]

I thought you said
robots can't cry.

I also said they
couldn't love.

[ crying]:
I loved it like it was me own!

Ah... at least
he's not laughing.

Oh, I remember the laughs
we used to share... [ crying]

SpongeBob, how
did that movie
of yours end?

The movie?

Oh, yeah, the ending was great!

Turns out there weren't
any robots after all.

It was just their...
imagination.

[ laughs nervously]

Hey, it's time
to feed Gary.

[ runs quickly]

[ chuckles nervously]

[ Krabs growling]

Squidward!

[ gasps]

Gary, the paper's here!

You can have
this, buddy,

because all I need is
the "entertainment section."

[ humming]

I am a happy sponge!

[ laughs]

[ laughing]

[ meows]

[ laughing]

I see you got
the paper.

Oh, hey, Patrick.

[ clears throat]

Well, I better
get going.

Yep, see you later.

Cheepcheepcheep.

SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK:
What did you say?

I didn't say
anything.

I didn't say
anything either.

BOTH:
See you later, then.

Cheepcheepcheep.

All right, quit
messing with me.

I know you said
something.

Ah, but it is you

that is messing
with me.

Cheepcheepcheep.

That's what's
messing with us.

It's a baby scallop.

I'll take care of this.

SPONGEBOB:
No, Patrick.

It's totally helpless.

It looks like
he can't even fly yet.

Well, what's
the matter?

Is he stupid?

No, Patrick,
he's just a baby.

He's all alone
with no one to
take care of him.

Well, we can't just
leave him out here.

You're right.

Come on, let's
take him into
the pineapple.

Let's see, we need a box
for him to sleep in.

There you go.

It's the best seat
in the house.

[ plays rimshot]

Let me see.

Hey, it's
kind of cute.

Uhoh!

I think
somebody's hungry!

Is it true?

Are you hungry?

Cheepcheepcheepcheep!

I've got just the thing.

How would you like
a Krabby Patty?

[ yelps]

SpongeBob
SquarePants,
are you crazy?

That's not
the right food

for a little fellow
like him.

Of course not.

I don't know
what I was thinking.

He needs a tiny
Krabby Patty.

[ sniffs]

Bleah!

Huh?

No one's ever turned down
one of these down before.

Let's try a doughnut.

[ hisses]

French fries?

Uhuh.

A doughnut?

[ blows raspberry]

All we have left

is this apple.

Hello,
sea creatures!

I bring you greetings
from Apple World.

[ chirps urgently]

Of course.

Scallops love worms.

Huh? Wait!

WORM [ shouting]:
We will bury you!

[ scallop gulps]

Well, you should be good
for the rest...

[ cries]

What now?

I don't know!

[ wailing]

Aw, don't cry!

[ wailing]

Do something, SpongeBob!

Uh... uh... uh...

Blahblahblah,
look at the funny face!

Doo, doodoo, doodoo,
look at the funny face!

Look at the funny face.

Wait!

I think I might
know the problem.

Yep, that's it all right.

Hold on just one second.

Here he is, good as new.

How did you know?

How do you think?

And I been doing it
all by myself

for almost a year.

Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.

I know, good thing
there's two of us.

You know, Patrick,
since this scallop
doesn't have parents,

we should raise it
ourselves.

Yeah, at least
till it's old enough

to be on its own.

Oh, I want to be
the mom!

I don't think you can be the mom
because you never wear a shirt.

You're right.

If I was a mom, this
would be kind of shocking.

Just call me "Daddy"!

[ upbeat background 
music plays]

PATRICK:
It sure is cute
when it's asleep.

SPONGEBOB:
Yeah.

[ scallop snoring softly]

Shh!

Hey, SpongeBob.

Yes, Patrick?

I never thought being a parent
could be this much fun.

Me neither.

Well, good night, SpongeBob.

Good night, Patrick.

SPONGEBOB:
Patrick, breakfast is ready!

[ food sizzling]

PATRICK:
All right!

All this parenting stuff
makes me hungry.

[ burps loudly]

Hey, Junior,
how you doing today?

[ sniffs]

SpongeBob?

SPONGEBOB:
Yes, Patrick?

Kid's got a stinky.

Could you change him?

My hands are full.

[ crying]

Ahh...

Wish I could,
but I got to get going.

Going? Where are you going?

Going to work.

I'm the dad, remember?

You mean I have to do
all this baby stuff myself?

I'll give you a break tonight
when I get home.

Don't you two stop
being adorable.

[ chuckles]

Okay.

[ laughs weakly]

Phew! What a day.

Oh, great, you're home.

Now you can help me
with the baby.

Aw, gee, SpongeBob,
I'd love to,

but I'm totally
beat from work.

Huh?

[ sighs]

[ "bonk" on TV]

[ laughs heartily]

That guy got hit in the head
with a coconut!

Patrick, what
about my break?

Oh, yeah,
your break.

Uh, tomorrow,
I promise.

Uh, okay, tomorrow.

[ scallop crying]

Phew, another tough day.

Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're
home after working all day.

I can't wait for my break.

Work was a killer.

I need my chair.

[ groans]

Patrick, I really
need my...

Tomorrow for sure.

[ weakly]:
Patrick?

I'll get to it eventually...

[ scallop crying]

Uh...?

Uh.

Patrick Star,
we need to talk!

Just one more minute
I got to...

Don't "one more minute"
me, Mr. Man!

Hey! I'm missing
the coconut.

You haven't been
helping at all
with Junior!

We made a commitment

and you're not
doing your share!

You never do anything.

I changed his diaper.

Yeah, once.

He's only this big.

How many diapers
can he possibly use?

Hmm?

Oh, that's not so much.

Hmm?

So?

Hmm?

Hmm?

Hmm?

[ quivers]

I had no idea!

What kind of father
am I?

[ whimpers]

I'll make it up
to you, buddy.

I promise.

So, what's the plan
for today?

No more fooling around.

From now on, I'm Superdad!

I'll work straight through lunch
so I can get home on time.

So make sure you save
a big old stinky diaper

for me to change.

And you could take
the night off, pal.

Great, so I'll
see you at 6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

6:00.

[ laughing]

Boy, that was some party!

Oh, hey, SpongeBob.

Hey, Junior.

What?

What?!

Oh, nothing.

Oh, what a relief.

For a second,
I thought you
were mad at me.

Do you remember
what you said to me
this morning?

Something about
root beer, right?

[ draws deep breath]

No.

Wait, wait.

Let me guess.

I give up.

Does "You could take
the night off, pal"

ring a bell?

Pfft... I don't need this!

What?!

Where do you think you're going?

I'm going back to work.

Work?!

[ growls]

[ grunts]

[ laughs]

He got hit in the head
with two coconuts!

So... this is work?

You know, it's not
as easy as it looks.

Sometimes I got
to move the antenna,

sometimes I lose
the remote,

and sometimes my butt
itches real bad!

Oh, you poor, poor thing.

By the way, you forgot
your briefcase.

Oh, so this is the thanks I get
for working overtime?

Overtime?!

[ arguing loudly]

[ scallop peeping]

There's that
stupid noise again!

Oh, that's not
a stupid noise.

That's just Junior
about to jump out
that window.

Oh.

SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK:
Junior!

Here, darling!

Here we come,
buddy!

Come to Daddy,
right in the
old pocket.

Uhoh!

Did you catch him?

No.

BOTH:
We're bad parents.

[ sobbing]

Cheepcheepcheep.

Cheepcheepcheepcheepcheep.

Junior?

He's flying.

I guess he's
all grown up.

[ kiss]

Hey, what about Daddy?

[ bonk]

[ kiss]

That's my boy.

Goodbye.

Goodbye, Junior.

Well, Patrick,
he doesn't need
us anymore.

This is the hardest part
of every parent's life...

I assume.

Despite all we've
been through,
it was worth it.

Yeah.

Let's have another.

NARRATOR: 
A slow day at the Krusty Krab.

Hey, Squidward, check this out.

Two ordinary Krabby Patties,

but when expertly tossed
with the skill of a champ

they become...

A oneway ticket to pain!

[ thud]

[ crash]
Huh?

SPONGEBOB:
Heave ho!

[ crash]

What the devilfish
is going on out here?!

Time is money,

and if you boys is wasting time,
then you're wasting money.

And that's just sick!

But we were performing a ritual
to attract customers,

and the only way it can work is
for us to get hurt... real bad.

What stupid barnacle
told you that?

Uh...

Listen, instead
of killing yourselves,

I've got something real
important for you to do for me.

Now, are you men ready
for your super...

BOTH:
"Super..."

Special...

"Special..."

Secret...

[ whispering]:
"Secret..."

Assignment.

[ screaming incoherently]

Put us out
of our misery.

I gotta know, I gotta know,
I gotta know.

The two of you are to paint
the inside of me house.

BOTH:
Yay!

But, let me give
you two a warning

this here paint
is absolutely permanent.

It will never
come off,

so if I see even one drop
on anything but wall,

I'll have your rear ends cut off
and mounted over me fireplace!

So have fun
with the job.

Patrick.

Yeah, SpongeBob.

Mr. Krabs sure has a lot
of expensive treasures

to drip paint on.

Do you think we should take this
stuff off the walls?

No way, SpongeBob.

We're not getting paid
to move stuff.

Patrick, we're not
getting paid at all.

Well, that's what I said

we're not getting paid,
and that's final!

Okay, we'll just paint
around all this stuff.

Good, just don't pay me.

First, we need to set out
the tarp.

Tarp, ahoy!

We're going to need
more coverage, Patrick.

Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

Well, I guess
we should open

these cans of permanent
paint now.

That will never,
ever come off.

And if we get it on anything,

Mr. Krabs will cut
our butts off...

And mount them on the wall.

PATRICK:
Careful, SpongeBob.

Careful, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob, careful.

Careful, SpongeBob.

Careful, SpongeBob.

Careful, SpongeBob!

Careful, SpongeBob!

Patrick, the lid's already off.

Oh.

Now it' my turn.

[ clang]

I should do this one,
too, Patrick.

[ both screaming]

[ screaming louder]

Well, that was a ripoff.

Okay, Patrick, let's get
our brushes ready.

Uh, maybe we should start
with a smaller brush.

All right, Patrick,
got to get started...

painting this wall...

with the permanent paint
that we can't get on anything...

but the wall.

Well, here we go.

Just a few more seconds
of mental preparation

and I'll be painting this wall.

I'm getting to the painting.

Can you move it along?

I'm all out of time cards.

No problem.

Here I go.

[ paints screeches]

[ paint screeching]

Yeah.

Huh?!

Barnacles!

What could be worse
than a giant paint bubble?

Oh, I know.

[ blowing]

Two giant
paint bubbles.

[ screams]

Patrick!

Yeah, SpongeBob.

I don't think it
can get much bigger.

Nonsense!

[ bubble creaking]

Pat, no!

[ explosion]

SPONGEBOB:
We did it.

We painted the whole house,

and without getting paint
on anything but...

Flopping flotsam! What's that?

We're dead, Patrick.

Do you know what that is?

Mmm, it's a dollar.

I win!

That's not
just a dollar.

It's Mr. Krabs's
first dollar,

his most prized possession.

And we got paint on it!

I think you
are overreacting,
SpongeBob.

[ chuckling]:
I don't see any paint.

Okay, this isn't
a problem.

Maybe I can just
wipe it off.

[ squeaking]

There, I think I got it.

[ whimpering]

[ screams]

Oh, now I see it.

This is not good,
Patrick.

This is not good.

Mr. Krabs is going
to be home soon,

and when he sees what we did
to his dollar...

[ slurps]

[ both scream]

Wait, SpongeBob, all we got
to do is wash the paint off

and Krabs will never know.

But Mr. Krabs said...

Forget what
Mr. Krabs said.

Every paint comes off
with something.

Did it work?

No.

[ saw buzzing]

Did it work?

No.

[ Patrick yelling]

Did it work?

No.

[ Patrick grunting]

Nothing's working!

Wait, SpongeBob!

We're not cavemen.

We have technology.

[ grunting]

It didn't work.

This is all Mr. Krabs' fault.

If he hadn't hung that stupid
dollar in the first place...

I mean, it's not like
it looks any different

than a regular dollar.

Why hang it?

You could just stick any old
dollar bill up on the wall

no one would even
know the difference.

You might as well just reach
into my wallet,

pull out a dollar
and put it on the wall.

Okay, Patrick,
take out your wallet.

I don't see where
you're going with this.

Hey, a dollar.

Our butts are saved, Patrick.

Now all we have to...

Patrick, no!

Patrick, no.

Why did you put it...?

[ screams]

Grab it, Pat,
grab it.

Hurry, hurry!

Oh, Pat, no, no.

Get it, Pat, get it,
get it, get it.

[ shouting incoherently]

[ weeping]

Want a bite?

Okay, okay,
we still got time.

Don't panic, SpongeBob,
panic is the enemy.

You are strong.

Through your strength
you shall overcome.

[ Krabs singing "Blow the Man 
Down" in distance]

You're on your own, pal.

[ screaming]

Hurry, Patrick, put the dollar
back on the wall.

I got an idea.

La, la, lalala.

What the...?

We're all done.

Everything looks great.

Yeah, you don't
have to look around.

We already did
that for you.

You both look like you got

a dirty little secret.

Ha, I'm kidding.

Let's see how you did.

Ooh, not bad, boys,
not bad.

A nice even coat,
high gloss, no bubbles.

Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs.

We'll just be going.

Flipping fish parcels,
look what you did!

Please don't cut off
our butts.

Oh, Mr. Krabs,
I'm so sorry.

"Sorry?"

You dusted all my knickknacks.

That was really nice.

Great Barrier Reef!

What's this?

That's not our fault.

I don't want
to be buttless.

Oh, and I suppose
the floor molding

just painted itself on its own.

That's what I call
craftsmanship.

Criminy jim jim!

You messed up my dollar...

rama.

All the dolls in this dollarama

were perfectly aligned.

Mama.

And you boys thought
I wouldn't notice.

Oh, well, I guess
no harm done.

All right, boys,

you're free to go.

Ow! That's funny.

I don't remember
a stack of paintings

where me first dollar
used to be.

In fact, I don't remember
this painting at all.

Or this one.

Or this one.

Or this one.

Or this one.

Or this one.

Or this one.

Hi, Mr. Krabs.

SpongeBob, what are you doing?

Oh, you know,
just hanging around.

Boo!

Get down onto
the floor, boy.

All right, now you're
just being silly.

[ screaming]:
No, no, no!

Mr. Krabs, no.

Don't look.

It's a trick.

Did you two get paint
all over me first dollar?!

BOTH:
We're so sorry,
Mr. Krabs.

And then did you
draw on it with crayon?

I thought, you know,
maybe he'd buy it.

KRABS:
All right, boys!

You know what I've got
to do now?

You mean, our butts?

Can I use mine
one last time?

[ slurps]

There we go, good as new.

BOTH:
But... but... but... but...

Yeah, I lied.

This paint actually
comes off with saliva.

[ chuckles]

Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs.

You told us the paint
was permanent

so me and Patrick
would be more careful

and not get paint on anything.

Nah, I just like
to mess with you.

[ laughing]

Oh, the old man's still got it.

Aw, crud.

I really got to learn to say it,
not spray it.

But mostly his sweat.

You may think
Mr. Eugene H. Krabs,

owner and founder
of Krusty Krab Inc.,

has always been the financial
wizard he is today.

[ Krabs humming]

NARRATOR:
And you're right.

[ Krabs laughing]

[ gulping soda]

NARRATOR:
After the war,

Krabs stayed secluded in a deep
depression that seemed endless.

But then his luck changed

when he acquired a bankrupt
retirement home,

and with a few minor
alterations,

The Krusty Krab was born.

[ baby crying]

Sounds like a lot of...

CHILD:
Hoopla!

NARRATOR:
Sounds like a lot...

CHILD:
Hoopla!

NARRATOR:
Sounds like a...

CHILD:
Hoopla!

Hoopla!

NARRATOR:
Sounds like a lot of hoopla

to make over
a little Krabby Patty, right?

[ chuckling]
Wrong!

[ contrived rock music riffs 
punctuating scene changes]

To keep up with today's
demanding customers,

no expense has been spared

to acquire
all the latest achievements

in fastfood technology.

This here is an advanced
pattycontrol mechanism.

Here you see our automated
moneyhandling system.

Don't touch.

These are highquality

beverage temperature devices.

Imported.

This here's a prototype
liquid transfer machine.

[ slurping]

And most importantly,

you get your stateoftheart

condimentdispersal units.

You going to buy something?

There's a standing fee.

NARRATOR:
All of this modernization

seems a little overwhelming
doesn't it?

Well, luckily for you,

Mr. Krabs' fear
of robot overlords

keeps the balance of technology
in check.

But if modernization
is the heart of The Krusty Krab,

then employees
are the liver and gallbladder.

Let's see
if you've got what it takes.

Hmm... poised, confident,
and a smile that says,

"Hello, world,
may I take your order?"

You've got the makings of a
good employee, Mr. SquarePants.

But for every good employee,
there's one who is not so good.

Let's see...
inattentive, impatient,

a glazed look in the eyes.

Look carefully

at the, "I Really Wish I Weren't
Here Right Now" button.

There's a name
for employees like this,

but we'll call him Squidward.

I'm getting paid overtime
for this, right, Mr. Krabs?

KRABS:
Sorry, can't hear you!

Does this mean I get to
make a Krabby Patty now?

NARRATOR:
No, you can't
make a Krabby Patty

without understanding
the phrase:

"POOP"?

NARRATOR:
Once you understand POOP,

you'll understand your place
at The Krusty Krab.

But what does POOP mean?

It's actually
a carefully organized code.

Watch closely.

Ah... POOP!

NARRATOR:
Looks like Mr. SquarePants
understands POOP.

Here's a typical customer.

I wonder what he wants.

Well, if we just remember POOP,
we can figure it out.

I'd like to order...

NARRATOR:
Do you think
he's going to order:

One patty, please.

NARRATOR:
Ah, POOP, you never let us down!

Now that you understand POOP,

I bet you think you're ready
to make a Krabby Patty.

Krabby Patty!

[ panting]

NARRATOR:
Hahanot so fast,
Eager McBeaver.

We haven't even talked about:

[ toilet flushing]

Every employee
of The Krusty Krab

must comply with a strict set
of personal hygiene guidelines.

Okay, Mr. SquarePants,

are you ready to prepare
for your shift?

A good employee always
scrubs his hands thoroughly.

Be sure to get under
those fingernails.

And don't forget
about the knuckles.

And make sure those palms
are squeaky clean.

All right,
let's see those hands.

Now, that's thorough!

[ chuckling]

After making sure
your feet are polished,

your face is clear
of any blemishes or boils,

and your hair is neat and tidy,

you are ready to start the day.

Now let's see how Squidward
prepares for his shift.

[ softly snoring]

Huh?

NARRATOR:
Remember, no employee
wants to be a Squidward.

Now that you're clean
and hygienic,

I'll bet you think you're ready
to make that Krabby Patty.

[ screams happily]

I'm ready!

I'm ready!

I'm ready!

I'm ready!

NARRATOR:
Whoa, there.

We still have a few more topics
to cover first.

It's important to keep your area
tidy and free of droppings.

But a clean workstation
is only part of the job.

To make the vision in your head
a reality, you'll need supplies,

and a good employee always keeps
his supplies wellorganized.

Very nice, Mr. SquarePants,
not a pickle out of place.

Now let's see how Squidward
keeps his workstation.

[ Squidward snoring]

[ shouts]

Oh!

[ cash register rings]

NARRATOR:
Don't worry, Squidward,

Mr. SquarePants
can cover for you.

Now that your workstation is up
and running, perhaps you think

you're ready to make
the worldfamous Krabby Patty.

[ barking]

[ panting]

NARRATOR [ laughs]:
Calm down.

There's plenty of time left.

We have to make sure
you're ready

for the psychological aspect
of the job

Mr. Krabs, can I
have a raise?

No.

NARRATOR:
Good job, Mr. SquarePants!

Can I make
a Krabby Patty now?

NARRATOR:
And now we move
from behind the scenes

to the front lines,
where we'll examine

the most important aspect
of the industry: the customer.

Or, as we like to say,
the "Krustomer."

Who said that?

Are you a ghost?

NARRATOR:
Like precious,
precious blood in an animal,

customers are what keeps The
Krusty Krab strong and alive.

Squidward, your ceiling
is talking to me!

Are you going
to order something

or just make friends
with the paneling?

Uh... I'll have an uh...

Uh... uh... uh... ah...

[ snoring]

[ snapping]

[ gasps]:
What's that?

Patrick, go be stupid
somewhere else.

NARRATOR:
Ahahah, Squidward,
remember what Mr. Krabs says.

The ceiling is right,
Squidward,

you're not
a very good employee.

Fine.

May I please take your order?

I'll have, uh...

[ droning]:
Ah...

NARRATOR:
We'll check in
with these two later.

Right now, it's important
that we discuss an:

Like the lost gold of Atlantis,

many consider their Krabby Patty
to be a treasure.

And as with every treasure,

there's a thief
ready to steal it.

So it's up to you
to be the watchful eyes of...

What's this?

It's Mr. Krabs'
business rival, Plankton.

Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs!

Your secret formula
is finally mine!

NARRATOR:
He's stealing the formula!

What are you going to do,
Mr. SquarePants?

[ screams]

[ SpongeBob screaming]

You'll never catch me, Krabs,

not when I shift into
maximum overdrive!

Hiya!

[ mechanical legs whirring]

I knew I should've
gotten the turbo.

[ SpongeBob screaming]

[ crashing]

Hear me, Krabs!

You'll take this
Krabby Patty from me

when you pry it
from my cold, dead...

[ Plankton squeaking]

[ squeaking continuing]

[ Plankton makes 
highpitched scream]

[ SpongeBob screaming]

NARRATOR:
And so another emergency
is avoided,

thanks to Mr. SquarePants.

Let's check in
on Squidward again.

[ droning]:
Uh...

NARRATOR:
Psst, Squidward.

Huh?

NARRATOR:
Just remember:

Patrick, if I could
make a suggestion,

why don't you just
order a Krabby Patty?

Great idea, Squidward.

One Krabby Patty, please.

[ sighs]:
Is that for here or to go?

Uh...

[ droning]

NARRATOR:
Hang in there, Squidward,
it's all part of the job.

Now that we've covered
all the basics of your training,

it's time for the moment
you've been waiting for.

[ humming dramatic music]

[ imitates cymbals]

[ resumes imitating orchestra]

[ pauses, pants]

[ resumes imitating orchestra]

[ holds final triumphant note]

Preparing the Krabby Patty!

At the center of every great
dynasty is the crown jewel,

which keeps it alive
and thriving.

For The Krusty Krab,
this is the Krabby Patty.

[ slurping]

And now you, the humble employee
off the street,

the alltoonecessary
human resource

that keeps this business afloat,

will learn the sacred
and dark secrets

of how to prepare,
with your very own hands...

[ gasps]

The sumptuous, lipmoistening,

spinetingling, heartstopping
pleasure center

that is a Krabby Patty.

Are you ready?

[ squealing]

Are you sure?

[ squealing]

Okay, the secret formula...

Welcome to 
"SpongeBob's House Party"

with your host, 
Patchy the Pirate.

There'll be punch, cookies, 
explosions

and a brandnew episode 
ofSpongeBob SquarePants.

ALL:
Hooray!

Now, live from 
Encino, California,

get ready for a warm embrace

from our party host, 
Patchy the Pirate.

Hey, get off my lawn!

Party?

Geez, there ain't no party here.

Go away!

[ squawks]:
Come on in.

Hush, Polly,
can't you see

I'm trying to keep
out the riffraff?

Riffraff?

That's our
television audience,
barnaclebreath.

Oh.

[ laughs]

Of course, it is.

I was just fooling.

Welcome!

Say, you didn't
bring SpongeBob
with you, did you?

Gee, I sure hope he
got his invitation.

I'd sure like to go
to this party,

but I can't read
the invitation.

Me, neither.

Whoever sent this
obviously has no idea

about the physical limitations
of life underwater.

Well, might as well
throw these in the fire.

[ fire roars]

Ah, well, come on in.

Let me introduce
you around.

This here's
Minnie Mermaid.

Minnie's cooling off
on account of

she's been dancing
her scales off.

Isn't that right,
Minnie, huh?

Take a little
breakiepoo?

No, Patchy,
actually I'm in here

because if I wasn't,
I would die.

[ laughs]

That's the spirit.

[ whimpering]

Let's see, who else
haven't you met?

Hey!

That's Longbeard,
the Pirate.

Hey there, Longbeard,
long time no see.

Who dares to
interrupt Neptune?!

Sorry about that, Neppy.

That's Neptune.

[ sarcastically]:
He's king of the sea.

[ laughing]

You kids having fun?

[ chuckles]

Hosting a party
is hard work, boy.

That reminds me of the time when
SpongeBob was hosting a party.

Hey, you kids want
to see that cartoon?

You do?

Well, then, launch the cartoon.

Ah, the Barg'n Mart
a consumer's paradise

of brandlike items stocked 
as far as the eye can see.

[ panting]

[ screams]

[ panting]

[ wheels screech]

Boom!

19 seconds!

That's a new record, Lou.

Uh, that's great, SpongeBob.

$1.42.

But it's not an official record

until we record it
in the Book of Records.

[ grunts]

"19 seconds."

Okay. So it's $1.42.

Sign here, please.

Initial here.

And here.

And... here.

Oh, look, it's a picture
I took of you

the first time I ever came here.

[ SpongeBob laughs]

Look at you,
so young and happy.

Where do the years go?

Hey, what's that?

"Plan Your Own Party Kit."

Hey, Lou, how much?

For the Plan Your Own Party Kit?

Oh, we're having a special
on those.

Uh, they're free.

But you have to leave...
right now.

SPONGEBOB:
Let's see, Gary.

According to the
Plan Your Own Party Kit,

invitations are the first
order of business.

"A short guest list

"consisting of only
your closest acquaintances

"will set an intimate tone
for the evening

and provide soirée success."

You heard the man, Gary:
only our closest friends.

Who the barnacles
is SpongeBob SquarePants?

I believe you went to
kindergarten with him, dear.

Kindergarten, huh?

Oh, yeah, SquarePants.

Well, I guess it's time
to move again.

SPONGEBOB:
Gary, this Plan Your Own Party
Kit is a real lifesaver.

How else would I have known

to make freshly whipped
clotted cream?

[ slurps]

Gary, you better call
an astronomer,

because this clotted cream
is out of this world!

[ timer dings]

My piñata.

[ panting]

[ squeals]

Ooh, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot.

The Plan Your Own Party Kit
encourages creativity

when stuffing your piñata.

That's why I'm using
deviled eggs.

[ meow]

Good question, Gary,
but not to worry.

The Plan Your Own Party Kit
warns that unsupervised parties

can lead to disaster.

That's why I've taken the
liberty of devising a schedule

8:00 to 8:05, guests arrive;

8:05 to 8:15, opening remarks
and general discussion;

8:15 to 8:27, craft corner,

followed by name tag
distribution.

At 8:27 we begin
the qualifying rounds

for our crackereating/
tonguetwister contest.

9:07, running charades;

9:38, charity applebob;

9:57, electric jitterbug
dance marathon

ladies' choice.

At 10:09, things start cooking

as I dip into my world famous
knockknock joke vault.

[ meow]

And as long as we stick

to this schedule,

our party is
a guaranteed success.

This is going to be
the coolest party ever!

Haha!

Looks like it's smooth party
sailing for SpongeBob so far.

Now it's time for me
to get me own party underway.

Gather round,
you scurvy landlubbers.

It's time to learn the
Peglegged Dance of Happiness.

Whoa!

It's quite simple really.

All you need is a peg leg
and some patience,

and my instructional video
series, only $29.95.

[ squawks]:
How tacky!

It's a $40 value,
Polly, a $40 value!

Now, it's very easy
and loads of fun.

Hey, everybody,
the band's here.

[ partygoers cheer]

Band? What band?

[ squawking]:
The band I hired
for the party.

[ laughs]

A jolly idea, Polly!

A little live music'll
get me shindig dug.

Who'd you get, Barnacle Bill
and the Seven Seas?

No.

Seaweed Sally

and her turtle?

No.

Oh, oh, I know
The First Mates.

No.

Salt Water Sam,

featuring
the Brine Brothers.

No.

Rusty Hinges

and the Boys
from the Brig?

They broke up
years ago.

Well, who else is there?

The Bird Brains.

[ laughs confusedly]

POLLY:
The Bird Brainsthey're better
than those other bands.

PATCHY:
But they're just
a bunch of birds.

Hello, Encino!

[ crowd cheers]

[ guitarist plays first chords]

[ drummer plays opening riff]

Oh, Polly, that's the worst
sea chantey I've every heard.

I certainly hope
it doesn't get any louder.

Ooh.

[ band plays chords 
very loudly]

[ screaming]

[ playing loud rock 'n' roll]

PATCHY:
No, no!

No!

Stop the music!

[ screaming]:
Stop!

Look, boys, I know you
fellas sound real good

around the birdbath,
but this here is
basic cable.

This is the big time.

I'm afraid it's time for
you to walk the plank.

You mean we're fired?

No.

Go on, start jumping

or you're going to be dealing

with the business end
of me sword.

[ laughs]

[ laughing]

No! I forgot that
you're birds.

[ wails]

While Patchy pulls 
himself together,

let's see how SpongeBob's party 
is shaping up.

[ crickets chirping]

Okay, Gary, get ready,
it's almost 8:00.

Here they come.

Don't worry too much, Gary,
it's only ten seconds past 8:00.

[ gasps]

Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00.

Maybe nobody got their
invitations.

30 seconds past 8:00.

Oh, I'm doomed.

No one's coming.

[ sobbing]

I'm the worst host ever.

[ doorbell rings]

Oh, the first guest,
and only 40 seconds late.

Hi, SpongeBob.

Welcome, Patrick.

May I compliment you
on being fashionably late?

Can I get you
a glass of punch?

Sure.

Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

Here you are.

Thanks.

[ slurping]

So is the punch okay?

Not bad, not bad.

Mmm, nice weather
we're having.

It's been
very mild, yes.

[ slurping]

Yep.

It's mild season.

[ laughs nervously]

[ clears throat]

So, you read any...?

[ doorbell rings]

Oh, more party guests.

Welcome, Mr. Krabs.

Ahoy, SpongeBob.

Please let Gary
take your coat.

Then allow me to offer you
some hors d'oeuvres

and a glass of punch.

KRABS:
Don't mind if I do.

[ meow]

Two down, 175 to go.

Gosh, I almost forgot.

These name tags eliminate the
need for awkward introductions.

[ doorbell rings]

[ gasps]:
More guests.

"Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh."

I don't get it.

No, you dumb bunny,
it says, "Hello,
my name is Patrick."

Nice to meet you,
Patrick.

[ laughs]

Good one, Patrick.

[ both laughing]

Yeah.

What's going on here?

The laughter isn't scheduled
until 9:03.

You want to throw a party,
do it at your house, Patrick.

[ doorbell rings]

Was he talking
to me or you?

Squidward, you made it.

My cable's out.

Oh...[ chuckles].

Sorry to hear about that.

So, uh, how's it going,
Squidward?

Not bad.

[ SpongeBob clears throat]

I have you making light
conversation with Mr. Krabs

from 10:41 to 10:47.

[ clucks tongue]

But if you've got a case
of the jabberjaws,

I can pair you up
right now with Scooter.

Here are some topic cards
to break the ice.

[ doorbell rings]

Someone's at the door.

Mine says, "Which came first,
the oyster or the pearl?"

You take the side of the pearl.

This is lame.

My card says, "Discuss
the philosophical nature
of irony."

What does yours say?

Nod politely.

What does yours say,
Plankton?

Oh, uh, yes, it says:

"Discuss the secret ingredient
of the Krabby Patty formula."

[ clears throat]

How interesting.

Nice try, Plankton.

[ guests murmuring]

[ doorbell rings]

Well, it's about time.

Okay, everyone, the final guest
is about to arrive...

[ quietly]:
22 minutes late!

Hey, hey.

[ chuckles lamely]

SPONGEBOB:
Attention, everyone!

Attention, please!

Now that we're all here,
I officially declare

the party switch
to be in the "on" position.

[ silence]

FISH [ bored]:
Whoopee.

[ smattering of applause]

FISH:
Hooray... all right... okay.

SPONGEBOB:
As soon as I get back
from the coatroom

we'll have a rundown of
tonight's scheduled events.

Try not to have too much fun
without me [ cackles].

Seriously.

That includes you folks.

"SpongeBob's House Party"

will be right back 
after these messages.

[ party music playing]

Ahoy, there!

Welcome back to 
"SpongeBob's House Party."

Hey, Gar, got
another coat for you.

The party's going
great, by the way.

They're going to be
talking about this one

for a long, longtime.

Well, back to "work."

[ cackles]

Okay, everybody, let's... huh?

[ music playing]

SPONGEBOB:
What's going on here?

[ lively conversation]

[ panting]

This is all wrong.

[ hyperventilating]

What's happening to my party?!

[ dance music booming]

No, no... no, no, no!!

Didn't you read the schedule?

"10:00 p.m.:
Dance your pants off."

10:00 p.m.!

[ vacuum whooshing]

Let's try to stick
to the schedule,
shall we?

[ slurping]

Cake will be eaten
at 8:52, everyone!

8:52!

[ vacuum whirring]

Hey, what's this?

That's my breakfast.

Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

[ music blasting]

[ claps]

SPONGEBOB:
Patrick.

[ needle scratches]

If everyone could take a seat

on the couch
while I sort this out.

Thank you, thanks.

[ partygoers murmuring]

Hey everybody,
thanks for your patience.

I know we've gotten off
to a rocky start here,

so I'm going to get us
back on track.

It is now 8:37,
and we all know what that means.

Time to read aloud
from the newspaper comics!

FISH [ dully]:
Oh... sounds like a...
real thrill.

Let's see, I think I'll start
out with "The Wisenheimers."

Okay, panel one:

we see Roxy Wisenheimer
with some sort of rake.

Wait, I can't read from this!

[ partygoers cheering]

This is yesterday's paper!

[ all gasp]

I'll just grab today's paper.

[ music starts, all cheering]

SpongeBob, you sure know
how to throw a party.

What would they do without me?

[ grunting]

Locked out?

[ knocking]

This song's
got a great beat!

Yeah
"knock, knock!"

[ knocking]

Gee, I wonder

why they don't hear me.

[ music thumping]

[ music blasting]

[ screams]

[ SpongeBob hyperventilating]

Oh, no!

They're not using
the topic cards.

They're... adlibbing.

Now they're mad at Patrick.

He's hogging the deviled eggs.

Oh, look at those poor souls.

They're so bored
they've gone mad!

Oh, no!

The party's falling into chaos

without my hosting talents
to guide it.

So... do you
come here often?

No.

[ telephone ringing]

Hello, SquarePants residence.

What?

I am sorry, what?!

Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.

You want to talk to SpongeBob?

Yeah... no, Patrick, 
I'mSpongeBob!

I'm outside.

Okay, hold on.

SpongeBob, are you out here?!

Phone's for you.

Wha... I...

No, Patrick, wait!

Sorry, he's not
out there.

Hey, dude, if you're
looking for SpongeBob

he's over
by the punchbowl.

Thanks.

PATRICK:
Here you go,
SpongeBob,

it's for you.

Phone in punchbowl?

That's not even on the schedule.

[ toilet flushing]

Larry, my man, you are looking
good enough to eat.

Mmmmm, oh, yeah, baby.

Could use a little
teethwhitener, though.

I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.

Hey, check out his crazy comb.

Oh, no, sounds like someone's

rummaging through
my medicine cabinet.

[ grunting]

I hope they don't
touch my special comb.

LARRY:
Well, I guess
I've aired it out enough.

[ window slams, 
SpongeBob screams]

[ SpongeBob screaming]

This party's finally
starting to pick up.

[ whimpering]:
I hope this doesn't interfere

with fingerpuppet theater
at 9:20.

If I don't get back inside
and restore order,

there might not be time
for any of the scheduled events.

Gee, SpongeBob really
knows how to throw
a great party.

Oh, yes.

Everything is quite lovely.

Ew!

Although I don't care
for his taste in paintings.

[ loud pop]

I don't even know
how that happened.

Well, I guess I have no choice.

I'm going to have to
tunnel back in.

[ music blasting]

Okay, everybody, don't panic.

The host has returned.

DANCERS:
Hop, hop, hop!

I can take
losing the topic cards

and the phone in the punchbowl,

but I was supposed to
lead the bunny hop.

This is a bunch of barnacles!

I'm breaking in!

[ siren whoops]

FISH:
Well, well.

What do we have here?

A burglar bunny.

Why do they
do it, O'Malley?

I don't know.

It's probably how
he gets his kicks.

You criminals
make me sick.

I'm no criminal.

I live here.

I... I'm just
throwing a party.

I got locked out,
I swear.

Well, why didn't you
say so?

What a terrible
misunderstanding.

You have a nice
party now, sir.

Boy, for a second there

I thought I was
going to be arrested

for breaking into my own house.

What an ironic twist
that would have been.

Hey, wait a second.

If you're
throwing a party...

why weren't we invited?

But I... you, uh...

I didn't know you'd...

Plan Your Own Party
didn't mention... the police.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Okay, motormouth,
tell it to the judge.

[ handcuffs clanking]

Oh, no.

These cuffs are broken.

Huh.

We can't bring him in
in broken cuffs.

I got an old pair in the car
we can use.

Is it too late
to offer you some punch?

Sir, you have the right
to remain silent.

All night in a stony lonesome...
in a bunny outfit.

Oh, yeah, the door's locked.

Good thing I keep a spare key
under... the... mat!

[ grumbling]

Oh, look at this place.

This party
was a complete disaster.

That was
the greatest party

any of us
have ever been to!

It was?

Oh, without a doubt,

you are the best
partythrower ever.

I am?

Yeah.

Whatever you did,
you should write it down

and do it again
next weekend.

Thanks again, SpongeBob.

See ya.

SPONGEBOB:
SquarePants,

you've done it again.

I guess I know how
to throw a party.

Gary!

Well, it looks like
you had a good time.

[ meows weakly]

Good night, Gary.

[ cackling crazily]

Whew, I'm glad to see old
SpongeBob's party worked out.

Now I got to get
me own party going.

Polly, are you ready
for some real music, huh?

[ squawks]:
Okay, ready.

[ blows loud note]

Oh...

Scurvy ain't
for the likes of me

Yoho, yoho, yoho, yoho

Yoho, yoho,

Oh...

Oh... scurvy ain't

[ squawks]:
It's time for
your flute solo.

Thank you, Polly,
I almost forgot.

[ hissing]

Hey, wait a minute.

I don't play a flute.

I play a fife.

[ screams]

Polly, no!

[ explosion]

[ all cheering]

Wow, I can't believe
I survived that one.

[ whimpers]

Polly, help me!

Ladies and gentlemen,
[ squawks] The Bird Brains!

[ cheering, music begins]

Come with me
to the land I love

It's not right here,
down the street or up above

It's down below
in the deep blue sea

Where SpongeBob lives
and the fun is always free

Down, down, down♪

To the bottom of the sea

Where our salty friend
SpongeBob

Waits for you and me

[ dolphin chirping]

Down, down, down♪

Ah, we'll have lots of fun

You and me forever
in the underwater sun

We'll catch some jellyfish
if we get a chance

Say hello to Patrick
and do a little dance

Karatechop Sandy

See Squid get a tan

Eat a Krabby Patty

And foil Plankton's plan

Down, down, down♪

To the bottom of the sea

We'll hook up with SpongeBob
and his snail, Gary

[ Gary meows]

Down, down, down♪

Oh, we'll have lots of fun

You and me forever
in the underwater sun

Underwater sun.♪

[ crowd cheering]

PATCHY:Aha!

Great job, boys!

Thanks for stopping by.

Hey, don't let the porthole

And thank you for stopping by.

You made this party

Ooh.

What did you get?

Let's see...

Gary, Gary, Gary,
Gary, Gary, Gary

hey, a magazine!

That's funny,
I don't remember

subscribing to 
Fancy Living Digest.

BOTH:
Whoa!

Look at these
glossy depictions

of a higher
standard of living.

SPONGEBOB:
This guy's so rich

he has a swimming pool
in his swimming pool.

PATRICK:
This guy's
got shoes!

SQUIDWARD:
Give me that!

Stealing my mail, eh?

You're lucky
I don't report you
to the authorities!

Hey, Squidward,

how do those people
get all that money?

They're entrepreneurs
they sell things to people.

What kind of things?

How should I know?

Things people
want to buy!

Now, keep your paws
off my mail.

That's it, Patrick!

We got to become
entrepreneurs!

Is that gonna hurt?

Quick, if you
could have anything

in the world right now,
what would it be?

Uh... more time for thinking!

No, something real, an item,
something you would pay for.

A chocolate bar?

That's a great idea,
Pat!

We'll be traveling
chocolate bar salesmen.

SPONGEBOB:
Fancy living...

here we come!

Make way for a couple
of "entrepenooers"!

Okay, Patrick, this is it,

the first step on our
road to living fancy.

Just follow my lead.

Good afternoon, sir.

Could we interest you
in some chocolate?

Chocolate?

Did you say "chocolate"?

Yes, sir!

With or without nuts?

Chocolate?

Chocolate?!

[ screaming]:
Chocolate!

Chocolate!

Chocolate!

Chocolate!

Okay, that first guy
didn't count.

This is our real first step.

Good morning, sir.

Would you like to buy
some chocolate?

Chocolate bars, eh?

Yes, sir, we are
chocolate bar salesmen.

[ chuckling]:
A couple a mediocre salesmen,
if you ask me.

That's no way to carry
your merchandise.

No, no, no, wrong.

You guys want to be 
goodsalesmen, right?

BOTH:
Oh, most certainly sir!

Well, no selfrespecting
candy bar salesman

would be caught dead
without one of these!

Wow... what is it?

It's a candy bar bag,
you knucklehead!

It's specially
designed

to cradle
each candy bar

in velvetlined
comfort.

But...

I'm wasting my time.

You don't need these bags.

We need them!
We need them!

So long, boys!

Happy hunting!

[ chuckling]

Suckers!

BOTH:
Fancy living, here we come

Lala, lala, la...

SPONGEBOB:
Let's try next door.

[ doorbell rings]

Yes?

Huh?

Say, weren't you
the same guy

who sold us these
candy bar bags?

I... don't recall.

But it looks to me

like you fellas have got
a lot of bags there.

You two ladykillers are
too smart to be

without one of my patented
candy bar bag carrying bags.

We'll take 20!

Oh, what can I do for
you two nice young men?

We're selling
chocolate bars.

Like to buy one?

That sounds heavenly.

I'll take one.

One chocolate bar
coming up!

[ zipper unzips]

Huh?

[ giggles nervously]

Eh...

Huh?

[ unzipping continues]

[ stammering]

Huh?

Uh, uh, uh...

[ giggles 
nervously]

[ panting, unzipping]

[ unzipping continues]

I know they're
in here somewhere!

I don't have
time for this.

[ door slams]

I got it!

One chocolate bar
for the nice...

FISH:
Chocolate!

Chocolate!

Chocolate!

Chocolate!

SPONGEBOB:
We're not doing
so well, Patrick.

We need a new approach...

a new tactic!

Huh...

I got itlet's get naked!

No, let's save that for when
we're selling real estate.

There must be something!

What was the reason
we bought those bags?

He said we were mediocre.

That's it
he made us feel special.

Yeah, he did.

I'm going back
to buy more bags!

No, wait, Patrick!

[ screeching]

Why don't we
try being nice?

Oh... okay.

Remember, Patrick,
flatter the customer.

Make him feel good.

Hello?

I love you.

[ harp playing]

You laid it on
a teensy thick
there, old pal.

Let me try.

Please. Go away!

Um... [ clears throat]

Uh, uh, how ya doin'?

How am I doing?

Wanna buy
some chocolate?

We got him now!

Sorry, chocolate has sugar,

and sugar turns to bubbling fat.

Isn't that right, lover boy?

[ giggling]:
It tickles!

As you can see,
me and chocolate no longer hang.

You can keep that
for five bucks.

I'll take ten!

We haven't sold
one chocolate bar.

I have a feeling we're
too easily distracted.

Huh?

Let's make a pact
right now

that we will stay
focused on selling
at the next house.

What?

Let's shake on it.

Did you say something?

Remember, Patrick,
focus.

Yes?

Good afternoon, sir.

We're selling
chocolate bars.

[ hypnotic music plays]

Why is Chubby here

PATRICK:
Focusing.

Back up, Jack!

[ Patrick grunts]

[ air hissing]

PATRICK:
Nice place
you got here.

I can't understand
what we're doing wrong.

I can't understand
anything.

There must be something
to this selling game

that we're just
not getting.

Other people do it,
I mean, look at that!

PATRICK:
"Eat Barnacle Chips,
they're delicious."

They are most certainly
not delicious!

Not the way
I use them.

Yet they sell
millions of bags a day.

Well, maybe if they
didn't stretch the truth,

they wouldn't sell as many.

That's it, Patrick!

We've got to
stretch the truth!

FISH:
Chocolate!

We'll work as a team.

Let me get this customer
warmed up

and then you come in
for the kill.

We're selling chocolate.

Is your mother home?

Yeah!

What? What are

I can't hear you!

They're selling
chocolates!

They're selling
chocolate?

Yeah!

Chocolate?

I remember when they first
invented chocolate.

Sweet, sweet chocolate.

I always hated it!

Oh, but this chocolate's
not for eating.

It's for...

You rub it
on your skin

and it makes you
live forever!

[ whispering]:
No, no, no...

Live forever,
you say?

I'll take one.

[ cash register rings]

MOM:
Come on,
you lazy Mary.

Start rubbing me
with that chocolate!

I hate you.

If we keep
exaggerating the truth,

we'll be fancyliving

Hooray for lying!

It'll make
your hair grow.

Great!

My wife's trying
to grow a beard.

It'll make you
sound smart.

I'll take 20!

It'll keep your face
from getting any uglier.

Just in time.

They make you fly.

You'll fall in love.

They'll bring world peace!

You'll walk through walls!

You'll rule the world!

[ doorbell rings]

[ giggling]

[ giggling]:
This'll be the best lie yet!

Yeah!

This guy will feel
so sorry for us,

he'll have to buy
all of our chocolate!

[ door creaks]

What can I do for you boys?

Hello, would you like
to buy a chocolate bar?

We need an operation.

FISH:
Really?

Small world.

What's the matter with you guys?

Uh...

We've got some head trauma
and eternal bleeding.

[ sighs]:
Some guys have all the luck.

[ violin plays]:
I was born with glass bones
and paper skin.

Every morning I break my legs

and every afternoon
I break my arms.

put me to sleep.

Oh, no!

[ glass shatters]

[ grunts]

[ glass shatters]

Ow.

Quick, Patrick,
let's help him.

Careful.

Put him down gently.

[ glass shatters]

Ow...

Poor, poor man.

If there's anything
anything

we can do
to help you...

There is one thing.

As you can well imagine,

my medical bills
are extremely high,

but luckily I'm able
to keep myself alive

by selling... chocolate bars.

Such nice boys.

It does my heart good...

to con a couple of classA
suckerroonies like those two!

[ laughing]

[ panting]:
Don't get me wrong,
Patrick,

it's great that
we helped him out,

but there's no one left in town
to sell chocolate bars to.

Whoa!

[ crash]

Let's face it, Patrick,
we're failures.

I can live
with that.

Let's change our names
to "Why" and "Bother."

Chocolate!

No, no, don't
hurt us!
Please...

[ sobbing]

[ laughing maniacally]

Finally!

I've been trying to catch
you boys all day!

Now that I've got you
right where I want you...

I'd like to buy
all your chocolate.

[ cash register rings]

Thank you for
your patronage.

Are we living the fancy life
yet, SpongeBob?

Not yet, pally.

First we got to spend
all the money.

But what are we going
to spend it on?

Hmm...

[ crickets chirping]

Good evening, sir.

Table for one,
please.

Sorry, but the whole restaurant
has been rented

to a private party.

But it's my only night
to be fancy!

Oh, who could afford to rent out
the whole restaurant?

Oh, a couple of
rich entrepreneurs
and their dates.

So, how long have
you two ladies
known each other?

What?

What did he say?

ANNOUNCER:
In a familiar restaurant
in a familiar part of town,

a call goes out in frustration.

Will you hurry up?!

I want a... uh...

Uh, no... uh... hmm.

Sir, will you please
order already?

You're holding up the line.

Uh...

Pssthey, Mermaidman,
get a Krabby Patty.

I've made my decision!

[ all cheering]

One Krabby Patty for me

and a Pipsqueak Patty
for the boy.

Now, wait just a darn minute.

[ all groaning]

I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty!

I want an adultsized
Krabby Patty!

The Krabby Patty
is too big for you.

You'll never finish it.

Don't you see
what you're doing?

You're treating me
like a child!

The boy's eyes are bigger
than his stomach!

[ all laughing]

And that's another thing!

I'm not a boy!

I'm so old I've got hairs

growing out of the wrinkles
on my liver spots!

[ hairs squeak]

One Pipsqueak Patty...

And your bib and high chair.

[ others laughing]

I'm 68 years old
and I want a Krabby Patty!

Your Pipsqueak
is getting cold.

Shall I feed you?

Feed this, old man!

ALL:
Ooh!

I'm tired of playing
second banana

to a man
who wears a bra!

From now on, I want
to be called Barnacleman!

And I'm through with
protecting citizens

that don't respect me!

I respect you, Barnacleman!

That's Barnacleboy, I...!

I mean man!

Oh...

Forget you people.

I say if you're not
going to give me

any respect
as a hero,

then maybe you'll give me
respect as a villain.

A villain who is... evil.

Evil?

ALL:
Evil?

Evil!

I'm crossing over
to the dark side.

I should waste money
lighting the whole store?

Did someone
say "evil"?

Man Ray and
the Dirty Bubble!

otherwise known as EVIL!

When will this crime wave end?

How will we defeat the EVIL?

Why am I asking you
all these questions?

Mermaidman, where are you?

I'm right here!

Don't worry, good citizens,

nothing will stop me
from defeating the EVIL!

Nothing!

[ tinny music playing]

Ice cream?

I love ice cream!

A double scoop of prune
with bran sprinkles.

Mmm!

[ fuse hissing]

[ slurping]

[ crunching]

Goes right through me
every time.

You might as well
give up, Mermaidman.

There's three of us
and only one of you.

You don't stand
a chance.

[ tires squealing]

Are you okay, Mermaidman?

Oh, how are you
going to beat

all three of those guys
by yourself?

You're right.

I give up.

You can't give up.

What if we help you?

No, no, that's
a terrible idea.

But what if you
help me?

Okay.

So, who wants
to save the world?

I do!

I do!

I do!

I don't.

Oh, yes, you do.

No world means
no money.

Now, go save the world
or you're fired!

[ grumbling]

MERMAIDMAN:
Then it's settled!

To the Mermalair!

SPONGEBOB:
Wow!

The Mermalair.

MERMAIDMAN:
These costumes belonged
to the original

International Justice League
of Super Acquaintances!

Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were
the most heroic heroes ever!

And you had
the best lunch box, too.

MERMAIDMAN:
Once you put on these costumes,

their fantastic powers
will become yours!

WowI didn't think
superpowers worked that way.

Sure.

Power's all in the costume.

Why else would we run around
in colored undies?

I can think of
three good reasons.

ANNOUNCER:
The Quickster

with the uncanny ability
to run really... quick!

Want to see me run
to that mountain and back?

You want to see me do it again?

SANDY:
Does this outfit
make me look fat?

ANNOUNCER:
The International Justice League
of Super Acquaintances!

A subsidiary of Viacom.

MERMAIDMAN:
So, it's agreed

we'll get one cheese pizza,

one with pepperoni and
mushrooms, and one with olives.

MAN:
Super Acquaintances,
we need your help.

Holy halibutit's the Chief!

Thank you
for the introduction, Quickster,

but we all know who Iam.

More to the point, we've got
news on the whereabouts of EVIL.

The whoseabouts of what?

You just tell us
where they are, Chief,

and we'll hogtie them faster
than you can say "salsa verde."

Our sources last saw EVIL

harassing teenagers
up at MakeOut Reef.

You know, MakeOut Reef.

[ kissing noisily]

Whoohoohoo!

Floppin' flounder, Mermaidman
MakeOut Reef!

Those fiends!

Attacking hormonally
stressedout children!

Ahh... MakeOut Reef.

Does this mean
we're not getting pizza?

Stop it!
Leave us alone!

Please, stop!

MERMAIDMAN:
Leave those young lovers alone!

You've saved us
the trouble

of tracking you down.

You fiends can't win!

You're outnumbered!

MAN RAY:

There are three of us
and only one of you!

Make that two!

Three!

Captain Magma!

Whoa...!

I'll cool you off, Quickster,
with one of my water balls!

Uh... ah...

Uh... ah... uh... ah...

Ahha!

Huh?

Nono, nono!

I'm not the Quickster,

I'm Captain Mag... ma.

[ wheezing]

Well, I guess it's up to me.

I'll just sneak over, unseen,
and catch them by surprise.

SPONGEBOB:
Get it off!

Get it off! Get it off!

[ shoes squeaking]

[ SpongeBob gasping]

Whew, glad that's over.

[ crickets chirping]

We... we did it, we won.

This day belongs to EVIL!

[ Barnacleboy cackling]

You've lost, Mermaidman.

And the superhero
supervillain rules say

you have to give in
to my demands.

Okay, what do you want?

World domination!

Tell him we want
world domination!

Oh, and make him
eat dirt!

In addition to the
domination thing.

Number one: I want to be
treated like a superhero,

not a sidekick.

Number two: I want
to be called Barnacleman.

And number three...

Come on, domination.

I want an adultsized
Krabby Patty.

Did you hear
him say

anything about
eating dirt?

Need a hand?

Super pal?

[ sniffling]

Good to have you
back on the side
of justice, Kyle.

Let's go get you
that Krabby Patty.

Was that it?

I feel sick.

Oh, this reminds me
of the time

I went to Cancún with
the Killer Shrimp.

Oh, they had these
papaya drinks...

Oh, Neptune, shut up!

[ chewing noisily]:
Mmm.

How's that adultsized
Krabby Patty

treating you,

Barnacle... man?

Actually, it's pretty big.

I'm not sure I can

I have school today.

What am I supposed to do all day

I don't know. What do you

Wait for you to get back.

Wait a second, Patrick.

Why don't you come

Hey, that's a great idea.

You and me in school together
as classmates.

Think about it!

Wow.

Brace yourself, Patrick.

I'm about to introduce you

to the greatest academic
thrill ride of your lifetime.

[ laughing excitedly]

I have no line.

Behold, Patrick,
the hallway of learning.

And here's the fountain
of learning.

And these are the lockers
of learning.

And these are the stairs
of learning, right?

No, they're just

Theseare the stairs

Late for being early.

It's the ladle

Oh!

And those drinks

Huh? Oh, sorry.

Attendance.

I'll add your name

I'll never

Oh, now, Patrick

I'm just like everyone else

Ahem!

Seventyfour.

Who said that?

Was it him?

I doubt it.

That's Roger,

What does he teach us?

The greatest lesson of all:
the precious value of life.

You see, Patrick, Roger Shell
represents the fragile line

between life and death
when behind the wheel of a boat.

This lightbulb
represents knowledge.

And without its energy

Think you can handle
the second chair?

I'm waiting!

This is gonna be great!

[ both giggling]

Hello, class.

My name is Mrs. Puff.

And the only reason I say that
is because I see we have

a new student.

Young man, why
don't you stand up

and introduce yourself.

Who's the fat kid
talking to?

You, Patrick;
she's the teacher.

Oh.

Come on, now,
tell the class your name.

Don't be nervous.

Uh... Duh...

[ teeth chattering]

We just want to know your name.

[ stuttering]:
Duh... Duh...

[ teeth chattering]:
Duh...

Duh!

Twentyfour.

[ laughing hysterically]

Oh, great, another genius.

[ laughter continues]

[ forced laughter]

Why are they laughing?

I guess it's just
in the timing.

Oh.

[ laughing]

Today's first lesson
will be on "Turning."

Twentyfour.

[ both snickering]

Hey, Patrick.

What?

I thought of something
funnier than 24.

Let me hear it.

[ stifled laugh]

Twentyfive.

[ both stifling laughter]

MRS. PUFF:
That's enough!

Young man, this
is your first day

so I'll let you
off with a warning.

As for you, SpongeBob

I expect more
from a good noodle.

Pay attention.

Yes, Mrs. Puff.

Now, then, "Turning":

what every driver should know.

When you are turning

it is important
to signal at least...

[ gasps]

"Big Fat Meanie"?!

Patrick, you
can't do that!

She's the teacher.

What about the teacher?

[ yells]
What...

[ teeth chattering][ gasps]

As if I really
look like this!

SpongeBob, I believe you know

the punishment
for two classroom disruptions.

No.

I'm sorry, SpongeBob

but if one wishes
to bea good noodle

one must behave
like a good noodle.

[ blubbering]:
I'm a good noodle!

I'm a good noodle!

You'll get this star
back when you earn it.

Nooo!

[ bawling]

No! No! No!

No! No! No! No! No!

No! No!

[ groaning]

Mrs. Puff,
is it nap time?

SpongeBob, I've had enough
of your nonsense.

Now collect your things

and move to the available desk

in the back of the room!

But... me? But why?

Because the Big Fat Meanie
said so.

Now go!

Thanks a lot, Patrick.

Sure thing, buddy.

Oh, I guess I could be
a good noodle from back here.

[ voice receding]:
Now, as I was saying,
when turning left, you must...

It's so hard to hear.

What kind of student
sits back here anyway?

Where am I?

Psst! SpongeBob.

Just ignore him, SpongeBob.

Psst!

SpongeBob, over here.

Whatever you do,
don't look at him.

Psst! SpongeBob.

[ grunts]

Psst!

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob?

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob.

Psst!

Over here.

I'm trying to tell
you something.

Something important.

What?!

Hi.

[ screaming]:
Hi!

[ growling]

Perhaps this would be
a good time for recess.

Hey, buddy.

Funny stuff
in there.

Funny stuff.

[ door slamming]

There is nothing funny about
what you did in there, Patrick.

You got me in trouble.

You got me moved
to the back of the room!

You caused me one
of my good noodle stars!

Who cares about a stupid star?

Gee, Patrick, it seems like

you would care a lot
about stupid stars

considering you areone.

I'll deal with you
after class.

It isafter class.

GROUP:
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

I don't see anyone
fighting, do you?

They're talking about us.

We're fighting.

I don't mind if I do.

[ grunting]

Fight! Fight! Fight...

This is embarrassing.

What's going on here?

Well?

SpongeBob and I were fighting.

[ gasps]

Fighting?

Well, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

SpongeBob Squarepants, I hereby
sentence you and your friend

to detention.

Detention?

May Neptune have mercy
on your soul.

[ bell ringing]

In one day I've gone from
good noodle to bad egg.

It's all stupid
Patrick's fault.

I hate you, Patrick.

I hate you more.

Well, I'd hate you
no matter what.

Yeah? Well I'd hate you
even if I didn't hate you.

I'd hate you
even if that made sense.

I'd hate you
even if you were me.

That's how much I hate you.

I'd hate you if even, uh...

mm...

I'd hate you even
if the lightbulb

keeping Roger alive
went out.

[ gasps]

[ shivering]

[ whimpering]

[ sleigh bells ringing]

[ groaning]

[ wind whistling]

[ both sobbing]

I'm sorry I called you
a stupid star!

I'm sorry I got you in trouble

and got you moved
to the back of class

and got your good
noodle star removed

and shot spitballs...

I'm sorry
your apology is so long.

Me too. Let's save Roger!

I'll keep him warm

and you get a lightbulb
from the supply closet.

[ gasps]

Lightbulb.

But why does it have
to be so far away?

[ breathing heavy]

[ glass breaking]

[ yodeling]

[ playing horn]

I'm coming, SpongeBob!

Oh, where's Patrick?

Oh, forget it.

I've got to go
find Roger some warmth.

The lightbulb!

Without its warmth,
Roger will die.

Roger!

Without him

the lightbulb will have
nothing to warm.

We did it, Patrick.

We saved Roger's life.

TEACHER:
Good job, boys.

I saw the whole thing

from behind
my oneway chalkboard

and I couldn't be happier
with your teamwork.

I've decided to give
you each one gold star.

Although, I'm not sure
what saving an egg

has to do with boating school.

Boating school?

I thought this
was Spanish class.

See you, SpongeBob.

See you,
Big Fat Meanie.

[ cracking]

[ chirping]

Hey, what'd I miss?

Uh...

What do you
like better?

The coral bits
or the nacho oyster skins?

I like neither.

Can I take your order?

How about
the barnacle rings?

Are they any good?

No. What will you have?

Well, uh, what's your vote
on the kelp...

Sir, let's just get
this out of the way.

I hate everything
on the menu.

Now what do you want?

Psst. Try
the coral bits.

Uh, I'll try
the coral bits.

That'll be one dollar.

[ cash register dings]

[ alarm blaring]

What's going on?

Something stupid,
I'm sure.

[ lively 
classical music playing]

Yippee!

[ laughing]

Whooha! Whooha! Whoo!

See? I told you.

What's wrong
with Mr. Krabs?

[ squeaking]

Nothing, lad.

Do you know
what this is?

A very dirty dollar?

No! This is my one millionth
dollar earned.

Every Krab's goal in life
is to make a million dollars

and now I got mine.

Congratulations, sir.

You have just given me
my one millionth dollar.

Great.

What do I win?

Nothing.

Now get out.

What?

Get out!

Everybody get out!

You're spoiling my moment.

My millionth dollar.

Congratulations,
Mr. Krabs.

Congratulate
yourselves, lads.

A captain's nothing
without his loyal crew.

I mean, a crew like you
comes along

maybe once in a lifetime.

And to reward you
for helping me

make my millionth dollar

I'm taking you on a trip.

Wow! A trip!

I can't believe
it, Mr. Krabs.

Where are we going,
Fancy Spring?

No.

Pamper Island?

Try again.

Oh, oh, oh!
Bikini Bottom
Folk Village.

Better than that.

Clam fishing?

This is the reward we get
for all our hard work?

Fishing for
stinky clams

in a smelly old boat
on a filthy lagoon?

You call this fun?

Aw, come on now,
Squidward

three fellas at sea
with nothing to do

but throw their lines
in the water

catch a few clams
and then throw them back.

Don't you think
that's fun?

No.

And to think I could be wearing
a powdered wig right now.

Hey, Squidward,
you want me to
cast out over here

so you can watch me?

How about you
cast out over there

so I can ignore you.

Okay.

[ blubbering]

Hey, watch where
you're swinging that...

SpongeBob

be careful with...

[ Squidward screaming]

Okay, I've
had enough.

[ chuckling]

Oh, Squidward,
you got to lighten up.

Sure, the lad's
a bit overeager

but you've
got to learn

to roll with
the punches.

Go with the flow.

And don't bring anything
on the boat

that you ain't prepared
to lose.

[ chuckles]

Ooh! Ugh!

Me millionth dollar!

SpongeBob

wait!

SpongeBob, you hooked
me millionth dollar

on the back swing.

Reel it in
before I keelhaul ya.

[ ominous orchestral 
music plays]

Oh, no.

SpongeBob, quick,
reel it in!

Can't you hear
the music?

That's a 4/4 string
ostinato in D minor.

Every sailor knows
that means death.

Reel it in before
it's too late.

Hurry, SpongeBob!

The music's getting faster!

There you are,
you stinking bilge rats!

Stop playing that music!

Stop it, please!

I'm begging you.

Come on, honey.
You can make it!

Swim faster!

Come to me, baby!

Come on back!

Hurry, SpongeBob!

Here she comes.

Oh, please, please,
please, please.

Please, please,
please.

She made it!

Yeah!

Oh, oh! Oh, hoho!

For a second or two,
I thought she was a goner.

[ scary music resumes]

[ roaring]

[ music continues]

[ sobbing]

So, some trip, hey, Mr. Krabs?

Oh, Squidward

you're never going
to believe it.

A giant bluelipped clam
ate me millionth dollar!

[ sobbing]

I lost me dollar

and I'll never
get it back.

Never, never, never, never.

I've never seen Mr. Krabs
so broken up.

[ sobbing]

Oh, please.

He's such a
drama queen.

Come on,
Mr. Krabs.

Drop the act.

[ blubbering]

Mr. Krabs, it's
just a stupid dollar.

[ blubbering]

For Pete's sake,
Mr. Krabs

suck it up!

[ blubbering]

Mr. Krabs.

[ wailing]

Mr. Krabs.

[ blubbering]

Okay, okay,
Mr. Krabs.

We'll help you get
your dollar back.

You will?

Great!

Wait right here.

Here's where clam fishing
gets serious.

Okay, you boys man
the fishing poles.

And I'll keep me eyes peeled
for Old Blue Lip.

Ayeaye, Captain.

And remember, we don't leave
until we catch that clam

and rescue me dollar.

[ bird squawking]

That's it.

I'm finished.

We've been here
for three days

and haven't gotten a nibble.

This is hopeless!

Yeah. And I've got to get home
to feed Gary.

We're going to die out here

just because a clam ate
Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar.

Well, if he wants
his dollar back

I say we give it to him.

Know what I mean?

Huh? Huh? Huh?

Oh, I get you.

[ jabbering]

BOTH:
Mr. Krabs,
Mr. Krabs.

Look what
we got!

Oh, could it be?

Me millionth dollar!

[ laughing]

[ giggling]

[ laughing]

Whoa.

Wait a minute.

[ squeaking]

This isn't me millionth dollar.

This is an ordinary dollar

that's been crumpled up

torn slightly,
soaked in the lagoon

and kissed with Coral Blue
Number Two Semigloss Lipstick.

Actually, it's Coral Blue
Number Three.

I trusted you,
and you gave me this!

I can't believe

me own crew would betray me
like this.

[ sobbing]

No. Uhuh.

No. We will not
be swayed by
tears anymore.

I see.

Then I guess I have no choice
but to offer a reward.

You're kidding?

Whoo! It isn't
another fishing trip?

No.

It's this sandwich.

A sandwich?

You expect me
to break my back

over a sandwich?

Not asandwich.

Thesandwich.

Whatever.

We've got plenty
more to...

[ water splashing]

...eat.

Now,I think
we understand each other.

Nobody eats

until I get my millionth dollar
back.

Uh, SpongeBob

can I have a
word with you?

Have you noticed

that Mr. Krabs
has gone

completely insane?!

What do you mean?

Just look at him.

[ sobbing]

Squidward, he's lost something
near and dear to him.

Haven't you...?

[ sobbing]Look again.

[ sobbing]

[ giggling]

You're right.

How do we get out of here?

If we're
real quiet

we can sneak over
to the lifeboat.

Okay.

[ screaming]

So, you thought
you'd skip out

on old Krabs, did you?

Even after you promised
to help me.

I know what you're thinking.

"It's just a dumb old dollar."

"Let's just leave the old man."

"He won't notice."

[ sobbing]

Well, it's not going down
like that.

There's only one use

for a backstabbing crew
like you:

live bait!

You're crazy.

If that clam didn't come before

what makes you think
he'll come now?

Oh, he'll come.

[ ominous music plays]

[ screaming]

Mr. Krabs, listen.

I work with SpongeBob
all day long

so I know what I'm talking about
when I say...

you are completely
out of your mind!

[ giggling]

Get us out of here!

Come on,
fresh meat!

[ screaming]

Keep thrashing!

He likes it!

[ screaming]

Come on, boy!

Closer...

closer.

Almost there.

[ roaring]

That's it!

[ screaming]

Aha!

Whoohoohoohoo!

Look, boys!

I finally got it!

I finally got
me millionth dollar!

[ orchestra plays scary theme]

Oh, poor Mr. Krabs.

Gone forever
out of our lives.

Why couldn't it
have been me?

Yes. Why couldn't
it have been you?

[ sobbing]

Why did he have to
go like this? Why?

Why did he have
to go like this

and leave me tied
to this idiot?

[ both sobbing]

MR. KRABS:
Hello, boys!

BOTH:
Mr. Krabs?

Have you boys met...

me millionth dollar?

[ chuckles]

Wow! How did you
get it back?

It wasn't easy.

Old Blue Lips is
quite the fighter

so eventually,
we settled on a trade.

What did you
give him?

Nothing important.

NARRATOR:
It's time for another

SpongeBob SquarePants special!

But it's not
an ordinary special,

because today we go to
Encino, California, as it was...

[ thunder cracks]

100,000,000 years ago!

So prepare yourself for:

With your host,
Patchy the Pirate!

[ cheering and applause]

Wheeha!

Hey, kids!

Now, you're probably wondering,

"Hmm, what's Patchy doing
in a cave?"

Good question,
you little[ murmuring].

Well, it's because
today's SpongeBob

takes place
in prehistoric times,

back when man struggled
for survival

and dinosaurs ruled the earth.

Isn't that right, Bronty?

But I'm riding you now!

[ laughing]

Stuck.

[ shouts]

[ shouting]

Get me out!

Help, help!

[ test signal tone whistling]

Like I was saying, prehistoric
times were the greatest.

It was a simpler time,
with simpler pleasures.

Your clothes always matched.

You could draw on the walls
and nobody would yell at you.

It was much easier
to hit a baseball.

Oh, yeah, prehistoric times
were the best.

Hey, kids, are those pterodactyl
wings I hear aflapping?

I think I know who that is.

Please welcome the Pottydactyl!

Sorry I'm late.

Why aren't you
wearing your costume?

I stayed up all night making it.

You're wasting your time,
old man.

Prehistoric stuff is lame.

Everybody knows
the future's where's it at.

What?!

That's not true.

Don't mind him, folks.

Why, even SpongeBob SquarePants
knows that prehistoric stuff

is... What do the kids say?...

cool!

No, he doesn't.

Yes, he does.

No.

He most certainly does.

No, he doesn't.

I know for a fact that he does!

Not.

[ gulps]

[ shivering]

SpongeBob!

What's wrong?

I don't know,
Mr. Krabs.

But I've got the
strangest feeling

that somewhere
a pirate and parrot
are arguing about me.

And the parrot is winning.

Does.Doesn't.

Doesn't.
Does.

Does.Doesn't.

Does!

Look, while we're arguing,

why don't you folks go ahead

and watch some prehistoric
SpongeBob.

Roll the cartoon.

Does.

Doesn't.

NARRATOR:
Ah, dawn breaks over
the primordial sea.

It is here that millions
of years ago, life began taking

its first clumsy steps
out of the darkness,

opening its
newly formed eyeballs

to stare into the blinding light
of intelligence, in order to...!

Uh, never mind.

This happened a long time ago.

Hey, there he is.

Come on in,

Come on.

You see, kids, I found him
frozen in a block of ice,

and then I spent three days
thawing him out

with my mom's hair dryer.

I call him Cavey.

Isn't he something?

It's okay, Cavey.

That's nothing, Old Timer.

Now I know how Squidward feels.

Why the long face?

I think you know
perfectly well, you
little wingèd vermin.

All I wanted was
to show the nice people

how great
the cavemen were.

But all they got was
technologyinduced chaos.

Come back inside.

I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

You got rid of the
robot android cyborg?

No, even better.

Potty, I guess I really
misjudged you.

Pretty sweet, eh?

You can run...

You'll laugh so hard

You'll swear you've died

When worlds collide.

Hold my hand,
I'll be your guide

When worlds collide.

Buckle, buckle, buckle up

And prepare to have
your mind blown wide

When worlds collide.

[ music scratching]

Yo, check it out.

When worlds collide,
it's a curious thing

In his metal chest

SQUIDWARD:
Closing time...

the happiest time of the day!

Closing time...

the saddest time of the day.

[ sobbing]

Huh?

That's a Krabby Patty.

Ew...

It's cold and hard.

This could have rolled
there years ago.

There, there, little one,
your journey is almost over.

[ siren wailing]

What happened?!

[ gasps]

Someone tried to
throw away a patty!

MACHINE:
Pinchomatic has saved you
5.2 cents.

But, Mr. Krabs, I found that
under the grill.

And tomorrow a customer
will find it under his bun.

But... it's old
and it's cold

and so very
full of mold.

You're not to make
another Patty

until that one is sold.

Understand?

Order up, Squidward.

Hooray.

[ flies buzzing]

Uh... SpongeBob...

can I get one
with less... fog.

Sorry, Squidward,
Mr. Krabs's orders.

Whatever.

Here you are, sir,
one Krabby Patty.

[ sniffs]

[ screams]

I don't understand

we haven't had
a customer in weeks.

I wonder if it's
the new placemats.

What?

[ stammering]

Placemats?

Have you
lost your mind?

It's that old patty

you keep trying
to sell to everybody!

It's gone bad.

Gone bad?

That's nonsense.

Bring it here,
SpongeBob.

Uh... Why is it in a cage?

Because it growled at me.

[ growling, barking]

You two would have never
have lasted in the navy.

Let's see
how bad you are.

[ growling, barking]

No!

No...

[ growling, barking]

Stay...

That a girl!

There, there.

See?

Good enough to eat.

[ siren wailing]

Oh.

Look.

An ambulance.

Now, then.

[ moaning]

SpongeBob?

Yes, Mr. Krabs?

Make sure you wrap up
that patty

I'm not finished
with it yet!

Well, Mr. Krabs,
you gave us quite a scare.

So I'm going
to be okay, doc?

Well, if you don't want
to take my word for it,

let's just check
your chart.

Let's see here.

Hmm.

Oh, no.

Oh, no!

This is terrible!

Everything okay, doc?

Don't touch me!

[ screams]

That's not a good sign.

[ lightening cracks]

[ ghoulish laughter]

Oh, no, it's
the Flying Dutchman!

Eugene Krabs,
your time has come.

I'm not Eugene Krabs,
I'm, uh, Harold!

Harold, uh... Flower!

Oh, sorry.

I must have
the wrong room.

Excuse me,
nurse?

NURSE:Yes?

I'm looking
for Eugene Krabs.

Oh, he's in that room,
right there.

No, that's
Harold Flower's room.

Harold Flower?

So, Krabs!

You thought you could fool
the Flying Dutchman?

What do you want from me?

I'm here to escort you
to the resting place

of all bad undersea folk...

Davy Jones's locker!

Davy Jones's locker?

Why do I have to go there?

I'm not a bad crab!

Ah, but you were cheap,

and being cheap is
a terrible thing.

Next stop
Davy Jones's locker!

[ Dutchman laughing maniacally]

Here we are!

[ sniffs]

Blech!

Why does it smell so foul?

Davy Jones
works out a lot.

These are his socks.

Get in!

[ sobbing]

Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman,

I don't want to go
in there!

I'll do anything!

Please, give me
another chance!

Come on,Krabs,

show a little dignity.

[ sobbing]:
Mommy!

All right, all right,
stop your crying.

I'll give you
another chance.

But you must always
be generous

nevercheap.

You have my word as a sailor.

SQUIDWARD:
Mr. Krabs'
nosehair clippers.

I could use these.

Squidward, you
shouldn't be going

through Mr. Krabs'
belongings.

[ sniffling]:
He won't like it!

SpongeBob, I told you
what the doctor said:

Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.

Now, keep quiet so I can hear
the tumblers in his safe.

Hey, boys!

[ screams]

Mr. Krabs, I knew it!

You're alive!

Squidward, look,
it's Mr. Krabs!

Isn't this too good
to be true?

Well, it was.

You know, boys,

being sick made me
think a lot.

My whole life has been
about money

saving money, collecting money, 
touching money.

Well, you get the picture.

But no more.

You're looking at the new,
improved, noncheap Mr. Krabs.

KRABS [ over loudspeaker]:
Welcome, all, welcome!

[ all chattering merrily]

Hello, little one.

What you got there?

A Krabby Patty.

[ chuckles]

Of course you do!

You know what
that means, right?

I don't go hungry?

No, silly!

It means: free toy!

Gee, thanks,
Mr. Krabs.

I thought you were
a cheap old tightwad.

I was, son, I was.

Free toys for everyone!

And free refills!

[ cheering]

Hello, boy.

Say, where's
Squidward?

Oh, he's taking one
of those break things

in your office

I mean the "employee lounge."

[ snoring]

Great!

Excuse me, I dropped
my Krabby Patty.

Could I get
another one?

SpongeBob?Yes, sir.

"Krusty Krab policy
clearly states

"once the burger has
reached the customer,

it is his/her responsibility."

SpongeBob!

That's the old policy.

Now run back and
bring out a fresh one.

Aye, aye, sir!

Sorry about
the confusion.

Free toy?

SQUIDWARD:
Eugene, my man.

Squidward!

How's the break coming?

Should be over in
a couple of hours.

Have SpongeBob
send back a patty

and an iced tea,
will you?

Sure thing, Squidward.

Take it easy.

Are you enjoying
your inmeal movie?

This movie hasn't even
been in the theaters yet!

No expense spared for
my valued customers.

Look at all those happy faces.

It sure does feel good
to be generous.

Here's your mail,
Eugene.

Thanks, Squidward.

You look rested.

Yeah, these naps at work
are doing wonders for me.

Credit card bills.

Well, I knew
this was coming.

Let's see what
the damage is.

Only $10,000
that's not so bad.

I'll just subtract it
from today's profit.

[ register ringing]

And... there's no money in here.

[ laughs]

How delightful!

Squidward, I'm worried
about Mr. Krabs.

Me, toohow are we
going to get paid?

Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are
taking total bankruptcy well.

Oh, it's just a bad dream.

I'll wake up
soon.

Uh, "dream"?

Sure.

I'm still
in the hospital

sleeping
like a baby!

Um, you checked out of
the hospital this morning.

Here's the bill.

You mean... I'm awake?!

[ screams]

No more refills!

Give me back them toys,
you freeloaders!

Show's over,
cheapskate!

[ movie audio plays in reverse]

Hey, it's my lucky day

a penny!

Your luck
just ran out!

Hey, man, ease back,

you're crushing
my arm.

Unhand that penny
or the arm comes off.

[ lightning cracks]

Ahhah!

That little display of
parsimonious penny pinching

just earned you a nice little
spot in Davy Jones's locker...

for eternity!

I'm not cheap, I'm generous!

You almost tore
a man's arm off
for a penny.

Thanks, Squidward,
I knew I could count on you.

Well, a deal's
a deal.

Let's go.

Wait just a
burgerflipping second.

Who dares backsass
the Flying Dutchman?

That would be me:
SpongeBob Backsass Pants.

I say you got the wrong crab.

This Mr. Krabs is
the most generous,

bighearted,
nonskinflinted crab
in the whole sea.

He'd sell your soul
for a couple of bucks.

I'd bet my soul
he wouldn't.

You got yourself a bet.

Okay, Krabs,
I'll let you stay,

but first help me
settle a bet.

If you had to choose
between SpongeBob

and all the money in my pocket,
which would you take?

That depends
how much money

we talking about?

Mr. Krabs?

DUTCHMAN:
Sixtytwo cents.

I'll take the money.

Mr. Krabs?!

Here you go, Krabs.

Sixtytwo cents.

Next stop
Davy Jones's locker!

[ SpongeBob screams]

Look, Squidward,
money!

Mr. Krabs, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

but how could you trade
SpongeBob for 62 cents?

You think I could have
gotten more?

He stuck up for you
and you sold him out.

You should be ashamed
of yourself!

Oh, what have I done?

[ sobbing]:
Oh!

I want another chance!

I didn't learn anything!

I lost my best fry cook.

I don't want this foul money,
I want SpongeBob back!

[ sobbing]

[ lightning cracks]

Here, take him back.

You heard what I said
about the money?

Heard what you said?

I couldn't hear myself thinking
with this one around.

I only had him for 30 seconds,

and it's jellyfishing this
and Mermaidman that.

What "not giving him back"?

He's a fate worse than death!

He's your problem now.

[ laughing maniacally]

Eh, eh, about trading you
for pocket change...

Say no more, Mr. Krabs.

You did it for the Krusty Krab.

I would have done
the same thing.

You would have?

No.

[ all laughing]

[ ringing]

Dutchman's residence.

So, as I was saying,

you and me got
to hang out more.

Well, what nights
are good for you...

[ sighs]

[ Patrick wailing]

[ continuing wailing]

Huh?

[ screaming]

[ video game beeping]

PATRICK:
Oh, I got dead again.

This game stinks.

[ screaming]

See, that's why
you must always

pay attention
to the mountain.

SPONGEBOB:
I'm listening to you, mountain!

Don't eat
the yellow sand, Patrick.

Oh, yeah, I forgot.

Hey, Sandy, watch me do
the "Grouchy Squidward"

Stop naming moves
after me!

[ as Squidward]:
Everybody's an idiot
except for me.

Well, it's true.

[ imitating Squidward's laugh]

[ gasps]

SpongeBob!

Look out for that tree!

Huh?

Don't worry,
everything's under control,

'cause I'm an expert...!

[ screaming "expert"]

[ stops abruptly]

Hmm... that's funny,

someone turned
the mountain upsidedown.

[ screaming]

SpongeBob, land
on your bottom!

It'll cushion the impact
of the fall!

Like this?

No, your other bottom!

Don't you have to be
stupid somewhere else?

Not until four.

[ glass shattering]

Ow, that's
got to hurt.

Do it again,
I wasn't looking!

Well, it looks like
your gluteus maximus

has made a
full recovery.

My what has a what now?

Your butt's all better.

It's really quite amazing.

It took 20 hours
to put it all back together.

We actually ran out of staples
and had to use a glue stick.

Yep, you're a lucky, lucky,
lucky, lucky, lucky, luckboy.

But from now on,

I'd like you to
be more careful.

One more injury like that

and you could wind up
like that poor creature there

in the Iron Butt.

Oh, man, it itches.

You heard the doctor,
SpongeBob,

one more injury like that
and it's the Iron Butt!

I've been too careless
back there.

From now on I am on
roundtheclock butt patrol.

Hey, step away
from the backside

I'm warning you.

What's your problem?

That was close.

MALE VOICE:
Hey, SpongeBob!

Why don't you join us?

We need an extra player.

Nice catch,
Percy!

[ yelps]

Hey, SpongeBob!

You've got to try this, dude!

We finally
got enough people

for a sevenmile
spanking machine!

[ slapping]

Ouch, ouch, ouch, ow...!

Next!

[ screams]

[ screaming]

Is this where
the line starts?

My butt is not safe out here!

[ door slams]

No part of me is safe.

PATRICK:
Whoohoo!

Yeah, ride 'em, cowboy!

[ laughing]

[ both laughing]

Hey, SpongeBob.

[ laughing hysterically]

Ooh...[ clears throat]

That was fun.

Hey, SpongeBob,
you ready

to go sand
boarding again?

SpongeBob?

Hello, friends.

Enjoying the
outside world?

What y'all doing sitting
in the middle of the floor?

Oh, living out the remainder
of my lifein safety.

If you guys were smart,
you would join me.

That accident
made me realize

that it's dangerous
out there.

I was one of
the lucky ones.

I'm a survivor.

And so I've
simply decided

I am never leaving
my house again.

That's crazy talk!

That's not crazy talk.

Thisis crazy talk.

[ jabbering]

PATRICK [ muffled]:
Sorry.

No, Patrick's right, Sandy.

You saw what happened to me,

and next time
it won't just be my butt,

it'll be my armpit
or my forehead.

Or your other armpit!

I was wrong
to go against nature.

I'm a sponge
what was I thinking?

Walkingmy people
are sedentary.

Just sitting
in your house?

Ain't you going
to get lonesome?

I won't be lonesome, I've got
all the friends I need here.

This is Penny.

And Chip.

And say hello to Used Napkin.

How are you going to keep
your job at the Krusty Krab?

No problem!

[ SpongeBob grunting]

SPONGEBOB:
A reallylong spatula.

[ patty sizzles]

What about eating?

I'm a sponge!

I'll just filterfeed.

[ breathing deeply]

[ gasping]

SpongeBob,
sooner or later

you're going to have
to go outside.

Listen, I told you that I'm
never leaving my house again!

Neverever?

Nevereverever.

Nevernevereverever
for neverever?

Neverevernevernever,
everevernever!

Nevereverever
evereverevereverever?!

[ exasperated]:
Neverever
neverever...

[ saying "neverever" 
over each other]

All right, Patrick,
that is enough!

Chip, would you mind showing
these two to the door?

[ chip plinks]

[ door hinges squeak]

Thank you, Chip.

[ door slams]

I guess I'll have to
find a new best friend.

Hey, Squidward!

No!

Aw.

Don't worry,
Patrick.

We'll get SpongeBob
to come outside,

and then he'll see there's
nothing to be afraid of.

And that's when
I punch him, right?

[ jellyfish buzzing]

Look at the
jellyfish out here!

Too bad SpongeBob is
missing out on all the fun!

I caught one!

[ electricity zapping]

[ Patrick screaming]

Look at those fools risking
their lives jellyfishing.

My new hobby is much safer,
isn't it, Chip?

Dust collecting.

I think I caught one!

We've got to try something else.

PATRICK AND SANDY:
Three cheers

On your birthday!

Three cheers for you!

Now, you've got to blow out
the candles and make a wish.

I don't need the wish, Penny.

Everything I could ever want
is right here.

In fact, let's sing our own song

about the joy
of staying indoors.

I know of a place
where you never get harmed

A magical place
with magical charms

Indoors, indoors, indoors!

Take it away, Penny!

[ silence]

That Penny has the most
beautiful voice.

That is it,
SquarePants!

We're going to find
something that's
so dang fun

that you'll have
to come outside!

Trampoline!

Ice cream!

Underwater surfing!

Two ice creams.

Ferris wheel.

Still two ice creams!

[ straining]:
Clam wrestling.

Washing an old person.

Patrick,
that's not fun.

It is for me!

[ gasping]

Nothing's working,
Patrick.

What do we do?

I say we take a bath.

What...

Will you get
out of here?

Now, remember
don't jump out

until I give
the signal.

Right.

All right,
SpongeBob,
you win.

Stay inside
forever.

Yours is truly the iron will.

Now, Pat!

[ jabbering]

Eek! A gorilla!

Save me, SpongeBob!

[ blowing raspberries]

Okay, guys, really.

This is your
saddest attempt yet.

Even Chip knows that's Patrick

in the same costume he wore
for Halloween last year.

No, really!

You've got to come save me.

Hey, Sandy
who's your friend?

But... but you're
supposed to be in
the gorilla suit.

I am in the gorilla suit.

I thought I was doing
a pretty good job.

If you're Patrick,
then who's that?

[ snarling]

[ gasps]:
A real gorilla!

Huh?

[ roaring]

[ screaming]

[ shrieking]

[ screaming]

[ Patrick and Sandy shouting]

No!

[ Patrick and Sandy shouting]

Oh, my gosh!

[ gorilla shrieking]

This can't be happening!

[ Patrick and Sandy shouting]

SPONGEBOB:
This is exactly the kind
of thing I was talking about!

Well, they were asking for it.

It's not like I didn't warn them
about the dangers of outside.

Yes, Chip, I know
they're my two dearest friends

in the whole world,

but I told them I wasn't going
outside no matter what.

We can do without
the namecalling,

thank you very much,
Used Napkin.

I know, Chip, if it was me
out there bagged by an ape,

Patrick and Sandy
would risk anything to save me.

And I've got to do
the same for them.

If I don't come back, Chip,
take good care of Gary.

[ meows]

Well... here I go...

from the safety of my home
to the outside world.

[ gulps]

[ straining]

[ whimpering]

[ door rattling]

I'm taking my first step.

So far so good.

I think I can do this!

[ paper smacks]

No!

Oh, dear Neptune!

Get off of me!

Get off of me!

Chip, help me,
help me!

[ gasping]

[ pops]

[ panting]

I'm still alive.

I did it!

I made it outside!

Nothing can stop me now!

Is it too late
to go back inside yet?

It's too late.

[ shrieking]

Patrick? Sandy?

PATRICK AND SANDY:
Yeah, SpongeBob?

I'm sorry I caused all this.

I'm not scared
of going outside anymore.

But I'm terrified
of gorillas now.

SANDY:
That's okay,
SpongeBobus, too.

You know what I don't
understand, though?

What?

What's a gorilla
doing underwater?

[ snorts]

[ man's voice]:
Uh, well...

it's funny you should...
You see, the...

George, they're onto us!

Let's get out of here.

[ meow]

Well, time to punch that clock.

But not before checking

my motivational
quoteaday calendar.

"You are a winner."

And today's the first day
of summer.

[ door opens]

Happy first day of summer,
Squidward.

Care to join me for
solstice caroling?

Walking in the grass,
it's all fine

Don't need shoes
in the summertime

I'm not much of a summer person,
SpongeBob.

Davy Jones on the jib!

Do my ears deceive me?

Is it really
the first day of summer?

Is it?!

Yeah.

Oowheehoo!

Gee, Mr. K,
you sure have

a scorching case
of summer fever.

What is it
about summertime

that makes us so happy?

The fireflylit nights?

The intoxicating aroma
of a charcoal briquette?

The hypnotic sound of a lawn
mower running over a flipflop?

The money.

The money?

Er, uh, I mean, uh...
the children.

Oh.

You see, boy,
during the summer

the children are excused
from their classes.

A recess commonly

referred to
as summer break.

Tell me more about
summer break.

[ bell rings] Well, during the summer break

the children wander 
Bikini Bottom unsupervised

their pockets lined 
with allowance

free to spend their money

without any parental guidance
whatsoever.

I guess that's what I like best.

[ cash register dings]

Sure I suppose some would try

and take advantage
of this situation

by selling them
toys or candy.

But I sleep well at night
with the knowledge

that I'm providing them
with something they need

a nutritious meal.

Come here,
you little piggies!

I've been taught the true
meaning of summer.

Almost closing time,
Mr. K.

What?!

But that's impossible!

What about the money?!

I mean, uh...
uh, what about the children?

[ sighs]

I guess summer isn't
coming this year.

Hey, maybe they're all
at that new playground
over there.

Playground?!

Luring away
me young customers?

Warm up the boat,
SpongeBob.

See anything, Mr. Krabs?

Oh, they're here all right.

Just look at them, SpongeBob.

So weak and malnourished

with nobody trying
to sell them nothing.

Breaks me heart.

[ sniffs]

[ cries]

No!!

I got nothing to live
for, SpongeBob.

The way you drove the boat

belying on the ground
was kind of cool.

True.

But that's not going
to get these munchkins

away from this playground.

Unless...

Hmm.

See you tomorrow, boy.

Got a lot
of work to do.

You got it, Mr. Krabs.

Hey!

Another day, another dollar.

Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has
been up to since I saw him last

and then went home to do
nothing of particular interest

till this very moment.

Huh?!

[ drill whirs]

[ hammering]

SpongeBob.

You're just in time for
the grand unveiling of...

Krabby Land.

Krabby Land, sir?

Yes, Krabby Land.

Where a kid can have fun.

For the right price.

[ chuckles]

Welcome to the Krusty
Krab, young man.

What's your name?

Monroe.

Nice to meet you, Monroe.

Whee!

[ change jingles]

Aha.

Okay, Money...

I mean, uh, children.

It's time for the grand
unveiling of Money!

I mean, Krabby Land!

[ cheering]:
Yay!

Okay, kids,
now promise Uncle Krabs

that if you get hungry
while you're playing

you'll come inside
for some delicious

We promise.

All right, here we go.

I forgot to give you
these coloring books

slash liability waivers.

Everyone who hands theirs back

gets to meet the one and only
Krabby the Clown.

Yay!
Yay!

Have fun.
And don't forget to eat plenty

of vitaminenriched
Krabby Patties

Krabby the Clown's
favorite meal.

We want Krabby!
We want Krabby!

Where is Krabby,
Mr. Krabs?

He'll be here after
I count their money.

Just stall them.

Stall them?
How do I do that?

I don't know,
be entertaining.

Duhuh... duh.

Hey, kids.

You're not
Krabby the Clown.

No, I'm not. I'm, uh...

I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick

the Krabby Patty... Burglar.

Lame.

Krabby will
be here soon.

He, uh, had to
take the bus.

But in the meantime,
let's have some fun!

You kids like bubbles?

No.

Well, you've never
seen my bubbles.

Voila!

A bubble shaped
like a jellyfish.

How about that?

Still lame.

Okay.

Prepare to be blown back
on your tail fins.

Tadah!

Uh. Uh.

You stink!

Bring on the clown!

Okay.

Now for a finale.

Boo!
Boo!
Boo!

Boo!

Boo!

Boo!

Boo!

[ booing]

[ sizzling]

[ screaming]

My eyes!

[ screaming]

Whoaohoh!

[ laughing]

They seem to respond 
to me being in pain.

They enjoy 
other people's misery.

Hey, kids.
Check this out.

[ screaming]

[ cheering]

I've got them
right where I want them.

Aah!

[ cheering]

[ screams]

[ screams]

[ screams]

[ cheering]

[ cheering]

[ laughing]

[ screams]

[ cheering]

[ chattering]

[ chattering]

[ laughing]

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

Ooh! Yow! Ow! Ooh! Yow!

[ laughing]

[ hands rip, SpongeBob screams]

[ cheering]

Mr. Krabs

I can't take much more
of this stalling stuff.

Always thinking about yourself.

Get out there and stall!

What happened to your arms
and legs, boy?

The kids are using
them as boomerangs.

Boomerangs?

Oh, no!
They might break my windows.

What are we going to do?

Well, now that all
their money's counted

tell them Krabby
has just arrived.

Really? He's here?

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh,
boy, oh, boy, oh, boy...

Get out there
and tell them!

Listen, everybody.

Krabby the Clown
is in the building!

[ cheering]

Who do you want?!

Krabby!

When do you want him?!

Now!

Krabby! Krabby!

Krabby! Krabby! Hooray!

Hey, kids.

Are you ready to meet
Krabby the Clown?

Yay!

All right. Here you go!

[ drumroll]

[ squeaky voice]:
Hey, kids.

Uh, thank you all for coming.

Thank you.

Eat plenty of Krabby Patties.

Doodoo, deedoodlydoo

Doodoo, deedoo.

Ah, Krabs, you'd done it again.

I'll say you have.

SpongeBob?

How could you, Mr. Krabs?

You promised these children
Krabby the Clown.

But all I saw up there was...

Cheapy the Cheapskate.

Hey, I ain't cheap.

Now take this tomato
back to the kitchen
before it spoils.

But what about
the true meaning of summer?

What about the children?

The children?

I don't care about the children.

I just care about
their parents' money.

Ah, the fact that their feeble
minds are easily manipulated

by cheap playgrounds
and talentless clowns

is no skin off my nose.

Survival of the fittest,
SpongeBob.

Survival of the fittest.
Hehheh.

[ clears throat]

Oh. Hey, kids.

Uh... Uncle Krabs
has to go to the bank now.

Get him!

[ yelling]

[ sighs][ blows thudding]

I suppose I'll never know
the true meaning of summer.

I thought I knew it once

but that was a long,
long time ago.

You mean this morning?

Yeah.[ clank]

[ children cheering]

Come outside, Mr. Squarepants.

It's a summer miracle.

Hoorah!

Wow, thousands of dollars
fluttering in the breeze.

I guess that's the true
meaning of summer.

[ cheering and laughing]

Where's Mr. Krabs?

He's missing out
on all the summer fun.

Let me go!

I got to get some
of that green stuff.

No!

Not that green stuff!

[ crying]:
No!!

Ah, finally,
the weekend is here

and this isn't just
any old weekend.

This is the weekend SpongeBob
and Patrick go camping.

Wouldn't it be great
if they got lost in the woods

and never came back?

Patrick, I'm scared.

Hoho, that would be great.

You've waited
a long time for this.

A soft bed...

Warm tea...

A good book...

And two whole days
with no [ silly laughter].

[ silly laughter]

What the...?

[ yelling]

SpongeBob
aren't you two

supposed
to be camping?

We arecamping.

SpongeBob,
it's not camping

if you're ten feet
from your house.

It doesn't matter
where you are

as long as you're
outdoors.

While all those soft city folk
are safe in their beds

reading books, we're out
here pitting ourselves

against the formidable
forces of nature.

You want to join us?

No.

Okay. Have fun inside.

[ laughing]

What do you mean,
have fun inside?

Just...
have fun inside.

See you tomorrow.

Oh. Bye.

You little sneak.

I see what
you're doing.What?

Don't think I can't
see what you're doing.

What?

You're saying
I can't take it.

But all I...

You're saying
I'm soft.

You think your little
"have fun inside" challenge

is going to make me
come camping with you

but that is
never going to happen.

There's no way I'm going
to sit out here all night

with you two losers.

So get used to it.

Okay.

Have fun inside.

That's it!
I'm in!

I'll show you camping.

Squidward's going to come
camping with us.

[ giggling]

[ panting]

Now you'll see how a real...

...outdoorsman does it.

Here we are
my remotecontrolled

selfassembling tent.

Watch and learn.

That was great,
Squidward

but how do you
get inside?

Yeah, it's all
crushylooking.

It isn't put up yet,
you idiots.

Customization.

Genius.

He's tenderizing
the ground.

Of course.

Write that down,
write that down!

Huh?

Voila.

But what could compare to just
lying out under the stars?

[ cheering]

Well, Iworked up
an appetite

as big as all outdoors.

Time for a little grub.

I suppose you two
are going to stew up

some twigs
and rocks, right?

No, we got something
even better

Marshmallows.

[ gobbling]

[ swallows]

Mmmmm.

Just like the astronauts eat.

[ imitates static]

Patrick to SpongeBob.
Patrick to SpongeBob.

Do you read me? Over.

[ imitates static]
SpongeBob to Patrick.

I read you. Over.

[ imitates static]
Patrick to SpongeBob.

I like going
[ imitates static].

Over.

[ imitates static]
SpongeBob to Patrick.

[ imitates static]
Me, too.

[ imitates static][ imitates static]

[ both imitating static]

SpongeBob to Patrick,
help yourself. Over.

Yummy.

[ glass shattering]

Patrick to SpongeBob.

The deliciousness
has landed.

Well, you two astronauts
can eat marshmallows.

I'm going to have a can

of Swedish barnacle balls...
just as soon

as I can get my can opener.

But, Squidward

didn't you take
a can opener

when you hiked out here?

Why would I bother?

We're ten feet from my house.

But this is
the wilderness.

It just doesn't seem to
fit the camping spirit.

Pretty weenie.

All right,
all right.

Give me
a marshmallow.

[ gasping]

[ gasping]

[ gasping]

Hahaha.

Hahaha.

Okay, besides spitting
molten foodstuffs at me

what else do you do for fun?

Well... after a long day
of camping

it's nice to unwind with
a nice, relaxing campfire song.

I call this one
"The Campfire Song Song."

Let's gather round
the campfire

And sing our
campfire song

Our CAMPFIRE
SONG song

And if you don't think
that we can sing it

Faster, then you're wrong

But it'll help
if you just sing along...

Bom, bom, bom

CAMPFIRE
SONG song

CAMPFIRE
SONG song

And if you don't
think that we

Can sing it faster,
then you are wrong

But it'll help
if you just sing along...

CAMPFIRE
SONG song Patrick!

Song. CAMPFIRE...

Squidward.

Good.

It'll help...

It'll help...

If you just sing along...

Oh, yeah!

[ sighs]

Now, wasn't
that relaxing?

No.

Thisis relaxing.

[ playing "Michael, 
Row the Boat Ashore"]

Oh, no!

I'll save you, Squidward.

Squidward, are
you all right?

That's it.

Chew... chew...
and swallow.

[ gasping]

There. Better?

Better?!

I was just fine
until you launched

that ballistic junk food
into my windpipe!

But I had to. It's
too dangerous

to play the clarinet badly
out here in the wilderness.

It might attract...

a sea bear.

A sea bear?

You mean like the ones
that... don't exist?!

What are you saying?

There's no such thing.

They're just a myth.

Oh, no, Squidward.

Sea bears are all too real.

It says so in the 
Bikini Bottom Inquirer.

"I married
a Sea Bear"?

Yeah, and Fake Science Monthly.

"Sea Bears and
Fairytales Are Real"?

That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

Well, maybe
it isstupid

but it's also dumb.

Patrick's right,
Squidward

Sea Bears are
no laughing matter.

Why, once I met this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this guy
who knew this guy

who knew this
guy's cousin...

You're right!

I should
be more careful.

In fact, why
don't you tell me

all of the things
I shouldn't do

if I want to keep
the sea bears away.

Okay, that's easy.

First off,
don't play the clarinet.

Okay, then what?

Never wave your flashlight
back and forth really fast.

Flashlights are
their natural prey.

You're kidding.

Don't stomp around
they take that

as a challenge.
Yeah.

Go on.

Don't ever eat cheese.

Sliced or cubed?

[ whispering]

Cubed. Sliced is fine.

Yeah, yeah. And?

Never wear a sombrero......in a goofy fashion.

Or clown shoes.
Or a hoop
skirt.

And never...
Ever...

Ever!
Duh!

Screech like a chimpanzee!

Wow. It's amazing

how many things
can set a sea bear off.

They're horrible.

And... and suddenly,
I have the sense

we're all in danger.

Why?
Why?

I don't know...

Just a feeling!

No.

Yes.

No.

[ imitating chimp]

Squidward, please don't.

[ screeching like chimpanzee]

SpongeBob, what are
we going to do?

A sea bear is sure
to come and eat us.

Don't worry, Patrick.

I'll draw us an antisea bear
circle in the dirt.

Good thinking.

All the experts say

it's the only defense
against a sea bear attack.

Hahahaha. You guys
are so gullible.

See? I did everything
that attracts a sea bear

and nothing happened.

If sea bears really exist,
why didn't one show up?

Maybe it's because
you're not wearing

your sombrero
in a goofy fashion.

Oh, pfft. Sorry.

How silly of me.

You mean like this?

[ laughing]

[ laughing]

No. Like that.

[ growling]

[ shrieks]

[ loud roaring]

[ yelling]

[ fighting]

Squidward, are you okay?

No.

Quick. Jump inside our
antisea bear circle

before he comes back.

Yeah. Sea bears
often attack
more than once.

Are you crazy?

A dirt circle won't
stop that monster.

I'm running
for my life.

No!

[ sea bear roaring]

[ fighting, yelling]

Don't run! Sea
bears hate that.

Thanks for the tip.

I guess I'll just
limp home, then.

No!

[ screaming, 
fighting]

They hate limping
more than running!

Well, I guess
I'll just have...

[ screaming, 
fighting]

I should have warned you
about crawling.

[ screaming, 
fighting]

What did I do
that time?

I don't know. I guess
he just doesn't like you.

Pretend to be
somebody else.

Here, draw a circle.

Okay.

[ screaming, 
fighting]

That was an oval!

It has to be a circle!

Move over!

[ growling]

Hey. It worked.

You guys saved my life.

[ cheering][ cheering]

Yeah. I'm glad it was
just a sea bear.

This circle would never
hold back a sea rhinoceros.

What attracts them?

The sound of a
sea bear attack.

[ snorting]

Huh. Good thing
we're all wearing

our antisea
rhinoceros
undergarments.

Right, Squidward?

Uhhuh.

Oh, no, I lost my pen.

You can borrow mine.

Thanks.

I lost something once.

I lost something
I couldn't live without

my identity.

So anyway, thanks
for the pen.

No problem, hon.

It all started last week
Monday morning to be exact

the day I lost
my identity.

I got to go.

[ blaring]

Good morning, world,
and all who inhabit it.

Awk! Gary, help! I can't see.

Gary!

Gary, are you there?

Gary? Gary, buddy?

I need you to be my eyes, okay?

Am I near the bathroom?

[ shrieks]

[ yelling]

Gary? Gary? Gar?

[ mews]

Gary.

Now that my horrific
incident of terror is over

how 'bout some breakfast?

The most important meal
of the day

Serving it up
Gary's waypop!

Enjoy, buddy.

Mmm. You know, I've been feeding
this to Gary for years

and I don't even know
what it tastes like.

Bleah!

Bleah!

Bleah!

What is it, Peterson?

I'm not sure.

I feel... a disturbance.

That was the worst thing
I've ever tasted.

Oh, well, at least
I'll never have to do it again.

Barnacles!

All these shenanigans
made me late for work.

Uhoh.

All right.

Hi, SpongeBob.

Hi, Patrick.

Lalalalalalala

Lalalala
lalalalalah

Lalalalalalalalah

Lalalala
lalala

Lalalalalalala

Lalalala
lalala...

Wait a minute.

When exactly did you
lose your identity?

Yeah, and
who's Patrick?

Why did you
eat SnailPo?

Have patience,
good people.

A great story
can't be rushed.

However, I willskip ahead
to The Krusty Krab.

Order up!

One Krabby Patty, grilled
with the fiery warmth

of my beating heart. Enjoy.

Thanks.

Uh...

Oh.

Is there a problem?

Well, you really should
be wearing a name tag

so I can thank you
properly.

While it is against
my philosophy

to disagree with a customer

I must point out that I am,
in fact, wearing a name tag...

right here.

Huh?

[ gasping]

Uh... SpongeBob.

Oh, Squidward,
it's terrible.

It's the most terrible thing
that's ever happened to me.

I lost my name tag.

[ sobbing]

Pourquoi?!

SpongeBob,
take it easy.

I'm sure you can
get a new one.

But I don't want
a new one, Squidward.

My name tag is
out there somewhere.

Lost... Hungry...

Who will help it?

What if
someone's using it?

All right, nobody move!

This is a bank robbery!

Attica!

[ shrieks]

I'm innocent, I tell ya.

[ whimpering]

Wow... Ooh...

Squidward,
what happened?

Huh? Oh, you fainted

because you lost your
name tag or something.

[ shrieks]

Huh?

[ gibbering]

[ gasping]

SpongeBob, will you get
ahold of yourself?

Since when is losing
your name tag

the end of the world?

Attention,
all employees!

Just a quick headsup, boys.

There's going to be
a surprise uniform inspection

in one hour.

Anyone who doesn't pass,
gets the boot.

This boot, to be exact.

It's very stinky

and you have
to wear it all day.

See you in an hour.

[ gasping]

SpongeBob, if
you really want

to find your name tag,
just retrace your steps.

Retrace my steps?

Squidward, you're a genius.

Huh. Huh. A genius.

Well, I don't know
about that, but...

Cover me till
I get back, okay?

Oh, sure, sure.

A genius. Well,
how about.... Hey!

Let's see.

If I'm going to retrace my steps

I got to remember
everything I did this morning.

Hi, SpongeBob.

Oh, hi, Patrick.

You said hi to me
this morning, right?

As I do every morning.

Well, I need you
to do it again.

That wasn't part
of the deal, Squarepants.

Patrick, what are
you talking about?

My hellos aren't just
some tape recording

that you can rewind
and play over and over.

They're special.

Patrick, this is
an emergency.

I lost my name tag
this morning

and I need to
retrace my steps.

You lost your name tag?

[ gasping]

Okay, Patrick, you
know the plan, right?!

I got it, I got it.

You're going to retrace your
steps and when you walk by me

I say, "Hi,"
just like this morning.

Perfect!

Mm, I guess I should start
with when I woke up.

I sure hope this works.

[ snoring]

Good morning, world,
and all who inhabit it.

Awk!

So far, so good.

[ yelling]

I don't see my name tag up here.

Now that my horrific incident
of terror is over

how 'bout some breakfast?

The most important meal
of the day

Serving it up
Gary's way.

Bleah!

Okay. Next I just have
to walk outside

and say hi to Patrick.

Patrick!

What?

You were supposed
to say hi to me.

Hi.

Oh. All right,
let's take it from the top.

Bye, SpongeBob.

Don't forget your
line this time!

I won't.

Good morning, world
and all who inhabit it.

[ yelling, crashing]

The most important
meal of the day

Lalala, Gary's way
Bleah!

[ frustrated growl]

Patrick, why
didn't you say hi to me?

What's my motivation?

Forget the motivation.

Just say hi!

[ groans]

[ yelling]

Hi, Patrick.

Wait! I'm Patrick.

I'm sorry. Sorry.

[ laughing]:
I'm sorry.

Let's try it again.

[ yelling]

Bleah!

Hi, SpongeBoob.

SpongeBoob?!

II saidhaha!

Who's SpongeBoob?

I said SpongeBoob!

[ laughing]

Again, again. Sorry, people.

[ yelling]

The most important
meal of the day

Yeah, yeah, Gary's way.
Bleah!

[ suppressing 
laughter]

I got the giggles.

Oh, what's the use?

I'll never find my name tag
in time for inspection.

Well, what did you do

after I said hi to
you this morning?

Hmm. Let's see.

I skipped merrily
to The Krusty Krab.

Said hello to old man Jenkins.

Hi, Mr. J.

Placed an apple
on Mr. Krabs's desk

and that's about it.

Oh, and these two guys
threw me in the dumpster.

Yiyiyi.

Good one, guys!

Whoa!

That's it!

Your name tag
is in the apple

on Mr. Krabs' desk.

Patrick, you're a genius.

Oh, wait, he's probably
thrown it away by now.

Well, then, we'll
look in the dumpster.

[ shudders]

What is that stench?

That is the stench
of discovery.

Come on, buddy, I'll
give you a boost.

Hop on, pal.

Yupho!

Hey, it's not so bad,
once you get used to it.

I wish I had a nose.

Come on in, buddy,
the garbage is fine.

Cannonball!

[ laughing]

You look over there

and I'll look over here.

Okay.

Patrick.

I'm looking, I'm looking.

Patrick.

Patrick!

I'm looking as fast as I can.

Patrick!!

Thank you.

Here, let me get that.

Hey, looka
Stingray 5000 single.

Hey, these guys rock!

Why would anybody
throw this away?

Have you forgotten
what we're looking for

knee deep in yesterday's
Top 40 songs?

Yes.

I'll give you a hint:
Two words.

First word, "my."

Second word, "name tag."

Could I have another hint?

Patrick, I would love
to sit here

and play "20 Questions"
with you

but I've only got
one minute till inspection.

Aah! One minute?!

Hurry, Patrick!

We don't have much time.

[ grunting]

Hey, SpongeBob.

Not now, Patrick.

I know where
your name tag is.

Where? Where?

Uh...

I can't remember.

Patrick, I don't
have time for this.

There it is!

Where?!

Uh. I forgot again.

Patrick, are you with me
or against me?

Well, could you
give me a hint?

There! I see it!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
the boy who cried, "Name tag."

If you're not going to help me

then just go crawl
back under your rock.

Well, at least I don't
wear my shirt backwards.

My shirt backward? What the...?

My shirt's on backwards!

I had my identity all along.

Oh, and just in time.

Thanks, Patrick.

Don't mention it, buddy.

Fall in for inspection!

All right, you two.

Hat and uniform
seem to be in order.

Hmm...

Promise me you'll shave
tonight and you pass.

Hoorah.

Okay, boy,
your turn.

I think you'll find
everything shipshape.

[ sniffs]

[ yelps]

Jumping jellyfish,
what's that stench?

Uh, discovery?

And that's how I got
my identity back.

Welp, that's my story.

[ yawns]

Well, you managed
to kill 11 minutes.

[ laughing]

Thanks, uh...

Betty.

What? Oh, sweetie,
I'm not Betty.

I just borrowed her uniform
while mine's at the cleaners.

MAN [ with French accent]: 
Ah, The Krusty Krab

home of the delicious 
Krabby Patty

and its supersecret recipe.

Attention,
Krusty Krab crew!

All hands report
immediately!

Fry Cook SpongeBob
reporting, sir!

What's all the yelling about?

Today is
the 25th anniversary

of the first time
me archenemy Plankton

ever tried to steal
me secret

Krabby Patty formula.

Can I have
the secret formula?

No!Okay.

KRABS: 
But he was persistent.

Pretty please?Uhhuh.

He used disguise...

[ evil chuckling]

superscience...

civil disobedience...

and I always
came out on top.

Fascinating.

But thousands of failures
have made him crafty

so keep your eyes open.

You never know
what trick he'll use

to steal me secret
Krabby Patty formula.

[ mechanical voice]:
What a quaint restaurant.

I think I will sample
their wares.

Ooh, how weird

a machine made to
look like a customer.

SpongeBob, why don't you go
hose out the men's room.

With pleasure, sir!

I'lltake this one.

Welcome to The
Krusty Krab, sir.

May I help you?

Yes, please.

I'd like an order
of chili coral bits.

You sure you don't want
a Krabby Patty?

No, thank you.

Will this cover it?

Uh... sure.

Here you go.

Good day.

Hm. I was sure it was
one of Plankton's tricks.

Well, at least his money's good.

[ chuckling]

Aha!

Plankton! You knew I would
never distrust a dollar!

That's right, Krabs.

Now, hand over the secret
Krabby Patty formula!

Or what?

I don't know.

I never thought
I'd get this far.

Well, then, allow me to
suggest your next move.

Yowww!

Curse you, Krabs!

[ laughing]

And now for the chaser.

[ water sloshing]

[ gasping loudly]

You just wait, Krabs!

Next time I'll... [ groans]

Who am I kidding?

At least I can go home
to a wife who understands.

[ feminine voice]:
So, tell me what happened.

I don't want to talk about it.

Talking will make
you feel better.

Leave me alone.

That's your problem
you never let anyone in.

Plankton the rock,
Plankton the loner.

And she's off,
ladies and gentlemen.

You have to do
everything yourself.

That's why everything you try
ends up like this.

[ laughs and groans]

And like this.

[ duck squeaks]

And more recently, like this.

[ flushing]

[ sobbing loudly]

I'm a failure!

It's not that bad.

You just require a little help.

Maybe some henchmen.

Henchmen?

Yes. What you need to do

is surround yourself
with muscular tough guys

who will do whatever you say.

I like the sound of that.

I'll canvass all the seediest
lowbrow dives in town

to find my minions.

And I know just how to speak
their language.

PLANKTON:
Felicitations, malefactors!

I am endeavoring
to misappropriate

the formulary
for the preparation

of affordable comestibles.

Who will join me?!

I don't get it
no matter what I do

I always end up being squashed
by someone bigger than me.

Oh, come on.

I think you're
overreacting.

Sorry.

That's okay
I'm no different

than the millions
of other plankton in the sea.

The plankton family

has always been pushed around
and stepped on.

Wait. That's it.

Acting alone, we're powerless

but united, the plankton family

could be a real pain
in the belly!

Krabs may think one plankton
is no problem

but let's see him take on two

or ten

or 100

or 1,000!

And why stop there?

I'll gather every family member 
from every corner of the ocean.

The entire plankton family

under one roof!

[ sneezes]

Krabs won't stand a chance

against 
the staggering intellect

of a million supersmart
criminal masterminds!

[ doorbell rings]They're here!

Welcome, brethren!

Hey, look here, buddy
it's Cousin Plankton!

ALL:
Yeehaw!

I've been away from home
longer than I thought.

Well, howdy, cousin!

Guh...

It's me, Clem.

Of course, you remember Zeke

Rufus, Jete, Billy Bob,
Billy Jim

Billy Billy Bo Willy
Banana Fana Fo Filly

Doug, Enos...

Julio, Fletcher McGee,
Rainchild...

All right, I get it!

I mean, uh, come inside,
make yourself at home.

I'd like you to meet
my computer wife, Karen.

[ plankton whistling]Golly, she sure is
pretty, Sheldon.

KAREN:Sheldon?

Yes, that's my first name.

[ Karen laughing]

Sheldon?!Will you please...?

[ laughing]:
I'm sorry.All right

[ laughter 
continues]as I was saying...

Okay, we all know
Sheldon's a funny name.

Ohokay.
Okay, I'm done.

No more.
Good.

[ clears throat]:
To continue.

Only you can bring honor...

[ plankton laughing]

and dignity...

[ laughter]

back to the plankton...

[ laughter]

For years, it has been my goal

[ laughter]to acquire
the secret formula for...

Okay, that's enough!

Sheldon! Ha...

Bottom line:
we invade The Krusty Krab

so I can steal
the secret formula.

What do you think?

Uh, what's in it for us?

Hey, what about us?!

Well, what do you want?

Garsh! Could I get
a new string for my banjo?

And another boot
to match this 'un?

And some more memory
for my laptop?

What about root beer?

ALL:
Root beer?!

[ cheering]Help me get
the secret formula

and you can have as much
root beer as you can drink.

[ cheering]

Victory, thy name is plankton!

KRABS:
Well, Mr. Squidward

it's almost closing time,
and we haven't seen

eye or antenna
of old Plankton for hours.

Yes, sir, I think this time,
he's finally given up...

[ over loudspeaker]:
Attention,
Krusty Krab management.

This is your better
speaking.

What?!

I have the restaurant
surrounded.

Give me the secret formula

or I'll destroy
The Krusty Krab.

Eh, you and what army, bug?

[ chuckling]:
What army?

What army?!

Look around you, Krabs.

You planted grass?

Grass?!

[ laughing]

[ plankton all laughing]

Uhoh.

[ both screaming]

[ all yelling]

[ blows landing]

You'll never get away with it,
Plankton!

You're right
the pipes are
much too narrow.

Besides, what I really want
is the Krabby Patty formula.

Well, you might as well
forget it!

The formula is locked away
in me safe

and I'll never give you
the combination.

[ laughing]

Silence!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[ groans]

I think you'll find
we're more than capable

of figuring it out
for ourselves.

Oh, boys?

That's it
a little to the left.

Curse you plankton

and your ability
to join together

to form a working human ear.

[ plankton cheering]

Hot dog!

Yes!

It's mine! The formula's mine!

After all these years,
it's finally mine!

[ sniffs]

[ sighs]

Let it be known that on this day

I, Sheldon J. Plankton

singlehandedly overthrew
The Krusty Krab!

[ several plankton]:
Ahem!

AAnd if course, I had
a little help from the family.

Plankton, wait!
You can't look
at the formula!

Begging won't help.

I'm telling you,
you won't be able
to handle the truth.

There's some things
in this world

that weren't meant
for mortal eyes.

Eye.

Eye.

I don't care.

Drumroll, please!

Finally, after all these years

I'm about to find out what makes
a Krabby Patty taste so good.

The secret recipe
for one Krabby Patty is...

"A pinch of salt..."

Plankton, wait!

"...three teaspoons
of chopped onions..."

I'm warning you.

"...a cup of love..."

Don't do it!

"...mixed together

"with the most important
ingredient of all

"four heaping pounds
of freshly ground...

plankton"?

I warned you.

[ screaming]

[ continues screaming]

[ all gasp]

[ plankton yelling]

Hey, why ain't you running?

Well, I can't read.

Get out of here.

Hyuh, hyuh,
hyuh, hyuh.

[ grunts]

[ groans]

Hey, guys. Did
I miss anything?

Mr. Krabs, is this really
the secret ingredient

for the Krabby Patty?

KRABS:
Of course not.

And Plankton'll probably
figure that out

and be back again to find out
what the real formula is.

But don't
worry, boys

the formula's
safe from harm.

I got it hidden
in me most secret
hiding place

a place no one,
not even Plankton,
would ever figure out.

[ laughing]

Let me guessit's at home
under your mattress.

[ gasps]

Curse you, Squidward!

in your guarding hands.

What do we do first?

Uh... I suggest
we go to a nice quiet,
secluded location,

like behind
an old dumpster,
or a dark alley.

We could go to my house

and turn off
all the lights.

Perfect.

That way no one
could hear you
being strangled

I mean, uh, uh, protected.

[ laughs maniacally]

Perfect.

Yes, excellent.

[ both laughing maniacally]

[ both laughing louder]

Ah, but first
I got to do a few errands.

Uh, okay, but let's
make it quick.

"Quick" is my middle name.

Let's see, paper towels.

This one says,
"Best paper towel around."

This one says,
"Best paper towel in town."

Hmm.

"In town."

"Around."

"In town."

"Around."

What do you think,
bodyguard?

Whatever gets us
to your house quicker.

I'll take both!

Here you go,
Mr. SquarePants.

Hmm...

Is there something wrong?

I'm not sure if
these are my pants.

[ groans]

[ sniffs]

How about this one,
bodyguard?

Too overbearing?

Can we just go to your house?

Here we are,
SquarePants Manor.

Bodyguard, let me just
take this opportunity

to say you're the best bodyguard
a fellow could hope to have.

All right, enough
of the sappy talk.

Open the door
so I can strangle you...

I mean, uh, choke you...

I mean, uh, crush
your windpipe... I mean...

"Protect me"?

Thanks.

Don't mention it,
Strangler...

[ gasps]

I mean "bodyguard."

Now, where
did I put my key?

[ growls]

[ growling 
and sizzling]

Well, I can't
find them.

Do you want
to take a look?

Forget the key!

Let's climb
through this window.

[ grunts]

I can't reach it.

Can you hop up
on my shoulders, kid?

Sure.

With these spiky cleats,
anything is possible.

[ grunts]

"Cleats"?

[ screams]

Get your feet
out of my eye sockets!

I'm trying, but my cleats
are stuck in your corneas!

[ screaming]

Get off! Get off!

[ screaming]

Oh, oh, oh!

[ pops]

Don't be mad,
bodyguard.

Let me just grab the key
I keep under the mat

and we can get inside.

[ growls]

[ explosion]

There you are,
you little rascal.

Now to put it in the lock,

which should activate
the tumblers,

thus opening the door.

Step inside...

Close the door...

Well, here we are.

I finally got you all alone!

[ laughing maniacally]

I know, isn't it great?

[ both laughing]

Ooh!

Now you're going to
get yours, tattletale!

Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!

[ cheering]

A surprise party
to celebrate

my perfect ontime
percentage at work?

Oh, how'd you guys know?

It's on the invitations
you sent us.

Let's boogie!

[ partygoers cheering]

[ beach party music plays]

SPONGEBOB:
Bye, everybody,
thanks for coming!

Bye, Mr. Krabs, bye, Plankton,
bye, Sandy, bye, Larry,

bye, Pearl, bye, Mrs. Puff, bye,
Squidward, bye, the rest.

[ stampeding]

[ laughs]

[ sighs]

Alone at last.

Huh? What? What?

So we're
all alone now?

Just you, me
and the floorboards.

[ laughing maniacally]

[ laughing]:
Yeah!

[ both laughing]

[ knocking]

ALL:
Happy birthday,
SpongeBob!

How did you guys know
today is my birthday?

We just do what
the invitations say.

Let's boogie
some more!

[ crowd cheers]

[ beach party music resumes]

Thanks for coming!

Whew!

[ laughs]

Alone again.

Is it true?

Everybody's gone?

Uhhuh.

No more
parties today?

You've got everything
you need now?

Nobody's left,
we're completely alone?

Oh, yeah.

In that case...

[ laughs maniacally]

Great parties, huh?

Oh!

Sorry, tubby,
you got to go.

Wait, we can
trust Patrick.

He's my best friend.

Well, uh, I can't
take any chances.

For all we know, uh,
he could be the Strangler.

I'm the Strangler?!

Oh, I should have known!

I got to turn myself in!

[ panting]

[ crashes]

So Patrick's
the Strangler.

Gee, you think
you know a guy.

He's not the Strangler!

He's not?

[ tearing]

I am!

Hey, how'd you do that
without shaving cream?

Oh, it's a fake,
you idiot!

I bought it at
the party store!

Did someone
say "party"?

[ screams]

[ crashes]

I can't take it!

Wait, bodyguard,
I need protection!

Step on it!

I'm being chased by a maniac!

[ tires screeching]

I'm not safe!

Come back!

[ tires screeching]

[ gasps]

Finally! Away from that guy.

SPONGEBOB:
Good idea,
bodyguard.

He'll never
find us up here.

[ screams]

SPONGEBOB:
Good thinking, bodyguard.

The Strangler could have been
on that plane.

[ screams]

Bodyguard!
Bodyguard!

Look, kid...

I'm not your bodyguard!

[ sobbing]

[ sobbing]:
I'm the Strangler.

See?

[ screams]

The Strangler!

Good work,
SpongeBob.

You put the Strangler
behind bars.

At least I'm safe
from that yellow idiot.

PATRICK:
Hey, Mack.

What are you in for?

Well, Patrick, here it is,
the Palace of Pranks,

the greatest novelty shop
in Bikini Bottom.

All the greatest pranksters
shop here.

This is where I got
my gag seanut brittle can.

Oh, boy, seanut brittle
give me!

Patrick, wait, it's
a booby trap, remember?

Nice try, SquarePants, but it's
not going to work this time.

I'm going to have some of
your delicious seanut brittle.

[ grunts]

Where's
the seanut brittle?

[ laughs]

That gets funnier every time
you say it, Patrick.

Come on, let's go inside.

Seanut brittle.

[ bell rings]

[ sniffs]

Ah!

Nothing compares to the smell
of cheap plastic novelty items.

Pranks, gags and grossout toys
as far as the eye can see.

Isn't it everything I said
it would be, Patrick?

PATRICK:
Hey, seanut brittle!

[ boing]

Oh, darn it, not again.

[ laughs]

Good to see you,
SpongeBob.

How's my number one
customer doing?

Great, Frank.

This is my friend,
Patrick.

He wants to become
a prankster, too.

Well, pleasure
to meet you, Patrick.

[ screams]

[ laughs]

That's your
first lesson, son

the granddaddy
of all pranks,

the joy buzzer.

I don't get it.

You don't have to get it.

The prank is
for the enjoyment
of the prankster.

You see, Patrick,
Frank here is the master.

I learned all I know
about pranks from him.

Frank, let's see
what you've got.

Well, this came in
just this morning.

Have some gum.

[ explosion, 
Patrick screams]

Ha! Exploding chewing gum,
only $9.95.

I don't get it.

What can we get for one dollar?

One dollar will get you
this fake gag dollar

fool your friends into thinking
you've got a real dollar.

What else
have you got?

A whoopee cushion?

Nah.

Fake vomit.

No.

Real vomit.

Eww!

Have anything good?

Well, there is one prank
that I've been saving

for a real topoftheline
prankster

invisible spray.

Wow, invisible spray!

But I can see it.

Gee, Patrick, just
think of the pranks

we could pull with this.

[ cash register rings]

Good choice.

Now, be careful
with that stuff, boys.

It stains clothes.

Thanks, Frank.

SPONGEBOB:
Here it is, Patrick,

the ultimate prank

invisible spray.

What are we going
to do with it?

I know!

We'll go spray
the park bench

and then sit on it,

and when people walk by,

we'll be floating
in midair.

They're floating
in midair!

How do they
do that?

That's the ultimate prank!

Good idea, SpongeBob!

Well, let's
get started.

Okay, I'm ready.

Any particular reason
you took your pants off?

Well, that stuff
stains clothes, right?

That it does, Patrick,
that it does.

Good thinking.

Here, hold
this a second.

Okay, Patrick,
give me the can.

I think since spraying
the park bench was my idea,

I should get to spray it.

Patrick, spraying
the park bench

was myidea.

Yeah, but I said
it was a good idea.

Give me that thing.

[ both grunting]

Hey, the invisible
spray works!

MAN:
And on your right
if you look,

you'll see two
naked guys fighting
over a can of paint.

[ tourists laugh]

[ screams]

Oh, my gosh, Patrick,
help me find our clothes!

[ laughs]

I got to handit
to you, SpongeBob.

You look kind of funny.

[ laughing]

[ screams]

Righty, where are you?

[ laughing]

No one messes with Righty!

We'll see
how youlike it.

Kind of gives you
an emptyfeeling, huh?

[ grunts]

Yeah!

I seewhat you mean.

[ giggles]

[ grunts]

No guts, no glory!

[ laughs]

[ puffs weakly]

PATRICK:
I think this
thing is empty.

SPONGEBOB:
Oh, no, it can't be!

How are we going to pull
off the ultimate prank?

Thanks a lot, Patrick.

You used the last of it.

[ grunts]

Hey, I think
I found our pants.

[ clothes ripping]

Oops!
Here, these are yours.

Oh, forget the pants,
Patrick.

Let's get home and
wash this paint off.

Hey, SpongeBob, do you
know what time it is?

Oh, sure, it's...
half past invisible.

Gee, it's getting late.

Let's ask this guy.

SPONGEBOB:
Sir, but do you
have the time?

Sure, it's ten
to 3:00.

Thank you.

Don't mention it.

PATRICK:
Don't mention what?

Who said that?

Me.

[ screams]

Ghosts!

[ screams]

PATRICK:
Hey, I'm no ghost!

The nerve of that guy
and his driving eyeballs.

SPONGEBOB:
Wait a second, Patrick,

my brain just
hatched an idea.

Lay it on me.

Okay, we're invisible,
right?

Yeah.

If that guy thought
we were ghosts,

we could haunt everybody
in Bikini Bottom.

Oh, it's
the ultimate prank.

BOTH:
High five!

[ hands slap]

Let's go scare us
some suckers.

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
giggling]

Huh?

That's funny,
I thought I heard voices.

Huh?

I thought I left that glass
of peanut juice on the table.

And didn't I toss
that old lamp out yesterday?

And since when did I acquire
all these portraits of Patrick?

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
imitating ghostly wail]

BOTH:
We're ghosts.

[ wailing]

[ laughs]

I knew it was you guys!

All right,
joke's over.

Take off the sheets.

[ gasps]

It isghosts!

[ screams]

[ SpongeBob laughing]

Boy, we really
scared her!

[ both laugh]

PATRICK:
Who's going to be
our next victim?

A better question
would be, "Who isn't?"

Doubledark deepsea
light diet cake!

[ laughing]

You will soon be mine.

[ chomping]

[ burps]

[ screams]

[ squealing]:
Ghosts!

[ humming]

Huh?

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
imitating ghostly wail]

[ screaming]:
Ghosts!

PATRICK AND SPONGEBOB
[ in ghostly voice]:
Cowabunga!

Ghosts!

[ screams]

[ screaming]:
Ghosts!

Ghosts!

Ghosts!

Ghosts!

Toast.

Ghosts!

[ SpongeBob laughs]

It's officialwe're the
greatest pranksters ever.

The whole town
thinks we're ghosts.

PATRICK:
Yeah.

SPONGEBOB:
There's only one guy
left to scare,

and we'll have pranked everybody
in Bikini Bottom

Mr. Krabs.

PATRICK:
It says he isn't
scared of ghosts.

SPONGEBOB:
We'll see about that!

Ghosts!

Hah!

I ain't afraid of no ghosts!

Every sailor knows a ghost
won't come near a fella

as long as he's wearing
his spotted neckerchief...

and his driedup sea leprechaun.

And a bit of gold never hurt.

But to be on the safe side,

I'm also wearing me pants
in a melvin knot,

got me shivering timber brace,

and the hairs on the back
of me neck are taped down.

And I'm all wrapped up
in a suit of antighost armor.

And if none of this stuff works,
I've got me secret weapon

the specter deflector.

So just try and get me,
you ghosts!

Bring it on!

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
imitating ghostly wail]

SPONGEBOB [ in ghostly voice]:
Krabs.

Krabs, we've come to haunt you.

Stay back, I'm wellarmed!

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
imitating ghostly wail]

[ voice quivering]:
I'm warning you.

[ knees clicking]

Ooh!

SPONGEBOB [ quietly]:
Boo.

[ screaming]

I got to get out of here!

SPONGEBOB:
You can't escape, Krabs.

We glued the door shut.

KRABS:
You'll never get me!

[ grunts]

PATRICK:
Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced
all the glass with rubber.

[ laughing]

[ screams]

SPONGEBOB:
Too late, Krabs, we've already
clogged all the toilets.

[ voice shaking]:
Please, spirits, leave me be.

PATRICK [ laughing]:
We got him good, SpongeBob.

SPONGEBOB:
Wait, Patrick,
I've got one more idea.

You're going
to pay, Krabs.

No, spirits, please!

[ SpongeBob squeals]

No!

[ SpongeBob shrieks]

No!

Don't burn me dollar!

[ both laughing]

Well, well, well, if it isn't
SpongeBob and Patrick.

[ in ghostly voice]:
I know not these names

of which you speak.

Uh, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob,
we're visible again.

[ both screaming]

So you two are
the Bikini Bottom ghosts.

We're really sorry,
Mr. Krabs.

Please don't chop us
up into little pieces
and eat them.

Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip.

I pulled my share of pranks
when I was your age,

had me some laughs.

That's what we did tonight,
right?

We had a good laugh.

Come on, laugh with me.

[ laughing]

[ all laughing]

Uh, any particular reason
you boys are naked?

Yeah, the invisible
paint stains clothes.

[ chuckles]

Of course it does.

Well, you two better hurry home
before someone sees you nude.

Yeah, I think I'd
die of embarrassment
if that happened.

Me, too.

No, wouldn't want that,
would we?

It's getting late now.

You pranksters better get going.

Mr. Krabs, thanks for
being such a good sport.

KRABS:
Don't mention it.

That Mr. Krabs, always
looking out for me.

What a guy!

Yeah.

KRABS:
The Krusty Krab presents...

live nude pranksters!

Starring the Bikini Bottom
ghosts.

[ cheering]

[ squealing]

[ laughing]

[ cheering and whistling]

[ laughing]

Patrick!

Yeah?

SPONGEBOB:
We should have bought
the whoopee cushion.

Good morning, pineapple.

[ bugle plays]

Good morning,
Gary.

[ meows]

Good morning, world.

I'm ready!

World?

[ humming]

Talk to me.

Package, sir.

Ahha!

I can't believe
it's finally here.

There you go.

Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

Thank you, Mr...
Tennis Balls.

That's "Tentacles."

[ door slams]

Squidward's last name
is "Tentacles"?

Poor guy.

[ whistling]

Hey, check out
Squidward's new snail.

[ whistles]
Fancy.

So that's what
came in the mail.

Looks like Gary has
a new little playmate.

Dream on,
SpongeBob.

I wouldn't let Snellie here
play with that mongrel mutt.

She's a purebred.

Wow. A snail made
out of bread.

No.

Purebred means
she's of the highest pedigree.

See?

She even has
her own papers.

So if you'll excuse us

Snellie has to start
her training.

Training?

For Bikini Bottom's snail race.

Snellie will be winning
this Sunday.

Sunday?

Well, I guess I can't
enter Gary in that.

Sunday's laundry day.

No, SpongeBob.

You can't enter Gary
because Gary's a mutt.

Boy, you got that right.
Gary's no...

Hey! What makes you
so sure

Gary couldn't
win that race?

Papers.

Hmm, "Property of
Squidward Pimples."

That's Tennisball...
Uh, Tentacles!

Come on, Snellie.

You know what?

I'm starting to get
the idea

that Squidward thinks
his snail is better than mine.

No!

Patrick, are you thinking

what I'm thinking?

Yeah, I should
get a snail

and enter it
in that race and
beat Squidward.

Are youthinking
what I'm thinking?

No, no, no!

I'm thinking about entering
you in that race

and beating Squidward's snail!

Looks like we're going

to start our training now,
ladies.

[ laughs]

I call you a lady
to humiliate and demean you.

It's a motivational tool
we coaches use.

Hmm, I don't know why

but I think I'll kick
SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.

Kelp powder for muscle mass

raw eggs 'cause they're cliche

and nails for toughness.

[ clattering]

[ meows]

Of course I expect you
to eat this.

It's scientifically designed
to help you win tomorrow.

Gary?

Wow, pretty good time.

Hey, SpongeBob,
check out my new snail.

Patrick, your snail
is a rock.

Yeah, thanks. I know.

He's got nerves
of steel.

See you at the big race!

Boy, the competition's
getting tough.

That's it, Gary.

We are going to start
some serious training right now.

[ meows]

All right, Gary,
let's start with some sprints.

On your mark, set, go!

Go, Gary, go, come on!

Go, Gary!
It's all yours, Gary!

Gary?

Come on, Gary,
the big race is tomorrow.

You got to start training
if you want to win.

Don't waste your breath,
SpongeBob.

That mongrel of yours
doesn't have a chance
against Snellie.

Excuse me

but you two seem
to be forgetting

who the real winner will be
my snail.

Patrick, that's a rock.

Yeah, thanks. I know.

He's got nerves
of steel.

Hey, what are you
standing on, anyway?

Like I said

don't even bother
showing up tomorrow.

[ loud crash]

My snail's really got Squidward
scared, huh, SpongeBob?

Sorry, Patrick.

Gary and I've got
some serious work to do.

You can run, but you can't hide,
Squarepants!

All right, Gary,
no more fooling around.

Time to get serious.

Come on, Gary, move it!

Up, up, up, up!
Down, down, down, down!

Faster, faster, faster!
Go, go, go!

Come on, push it,
Gary, push it!

Move that shell!

Come on, Gary, move it!

Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Faster!

Let's go! Let's go!
Speed it up! Speed it up!

Move it, Gary!
Move it, move it, move it!

Stroke, stroke, stroke.

Come on, Gary,
we're going to be late

for the big race!

Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen

and welcome to our live coverage

of this year's spring classic,
the 102nd Running of The Snail.

And what a beautiful day
for this sport of kings

of which I'm a huge fan.

Seriously, I'm just a fan.

I was on my way to my seat,
the door was open...

Hey, what are
you doing?!

[ gasps]

Sorry about that, folks.

Let's go down to the field

to join the mayor
for the pregame ceremony.

And now for the lighting of the
Torch of Good Sportsmanship.

Please join me

in welcoming snail racing's
firstever champion

Lightning Larry Luciano!

ANNOUNCER:
Would you look at that, folks?

Lightning Larry Luciano,
a living legend

slowly making his way
center stage.

And what a proud moment
for this sport.

The crowd is going
absolutely nuts...

for Larry.

He's almost there.

[ chuckles weakly]

Uh, yes, siree.

Any minute now.

He's almost a quarter
of the way there.

[ playing discordantly]

The torch is lit!

Let the race begin.

[ crowd cheers]

Well, SpongeBob,
I must admit

I didn't think
that mongrel mutt of yours

would even find
the starting line.

Congratulations.

[ laughs]

Save it for the loser's circle,
Squidward.

Gary happens to be
in the best shape of his life.

[ wheezing cough]

I'll alert
the paramedics.

[ laughs]:
Good one, Squidward.

You guys ready?

Uh! A burglar!

No, Patrick,
that's the official.

We're ready to start
here, folks.

Okay, Snellie,
let's show these

common, gardenvariety snails

what superior breeding
is all about.

[ meows]

All right, Gary,
listen up.

The competition is
going to be fierce.

You're the undersnail.

Everybody's already
counting you out.

Now get out there
and win

so we can rub Squidward's
big, fat nose in it.

[ meows]

This is what you've been
training for, Rocky.

This is why we're here.

On your mark, get set

slither!

ANNOUNCER:
And they're off!

Number six, Snellie, rockets out
of the starting blocks

leaving the other two
competitors in the dust!

What?

Go, Snellie,
you got it, baby!

What are you doing, Gary?!
The race has started!

You let Snellie
take the lead!

Let's go, Gary!
Start moving!

You're blowing everything
we trained for!

Blowing it!

It's okay, Rocky.
You go when you feel like it.

Gary, are you listening to me?!

Get the anchors out
of your pants right now!

Don't give me
that look!

I said now, mister!
Get going, Gary!

Go, go, go, go!

And there goes number seven
out of the starting gate.

Hang on, folks.

He doesn't look so good.

Not good enough, Gary!
Not good enough! Faster!

[ panting]

I do not like the look of this.

Come on, Gary, it's a race!
A race!

Have you heard of 'em?!

That coach is pushing that snail
too hard.

Faster, Gary! Faster, faster,
faster, faster!

Huh?

Oh! Looks like number seven
has a blowout.

Oop, make that two, folks.

[ all exclaiming]

Uh, Gary?

Plus a blown head gasket!

Oh, and the poor creature's
still going for it.

Um, Gary, you can stop now.

And he's losing control!

[ screeching]

[ all exclaiming]

You can take a breath now
if you want to, Gary!

He's spinning out of control!

He's heading straight
for the wall!

[ all gasp]

[ all cheer]

No!

Hold on, Gary,
I'm coming!

Whoaoa.

One of the coaches seems
to have raced onto the track.

That is an automatic
disqualification.

Looks like number six
has this race all wrapped up,

ladies and gentlemen.

Come on, Snellie,
it's all you, baby!

Oh, Gary, I'm sorry.

Why didn't you just say
I was pushing it too hard?

[ meows]

You did?

Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me
I wasn't listening?!

[ meows]

You did?

Oh, Gary!
Oh, Gary!

[ meows]

What?!

Gary?

[ both purring]

Oh...

ALL:
Aw...

[ laughs]

My, oh, my.

Folks, I have never seen
anything quite like this.

It seems Snellie, the leader,
just went back to comfort Gary.

Looks like you and I are
inlaws, eh, Squidward?

But that's impossible.

If Snellie didn't win, then...

And the winner is Rocky!

[ sobbing]

I can't believe it.

My purebred
which cost me $1,700

lost to a rock.

Don't worry, Squidward.

I know how much
you wanted to win

so I had the trophy
engraved to you.

Gosh, Patrick, thanks.

"The 1st Place
Snail Racing Cup

Presented to
Squidward Tortellini?"

Will I ever win?

[ all laugh]

That's for yesterday,
Squarepants!

What do you boys think
of me masterpiece?

SPONGEBOB: "New business
hours6:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

What?

That is totally unfair!

Squidward's right.

That's totally unfair.

Couldn't we get to work
earlier than 6:00 AM?

Like 5:30 AM?

Or 5:00 AM?

Or 4:00 AM?

Zip it.

What the?

The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?

So that little piece
of flotsam, Plankton,

thinks he can stay open
longer than me, does he?

Sure.

I don't know.

Why not?

Well, he's wrong!

Oh, OK, sure.

As of now, The Krusty
Krab is open 24 hours!

Did you hear that, Squidward?

We get to keep working
and working and working

without ever having to go home.

I got to pinch myself
'cause I must be dreaming.

Ow!

Oww!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, oww!

Owww!

Ow!

Well, I'm not dreaming.

PLANKTON: Open 24 hours, eh?

[CHUCKLES]

I knew he couldn't resist
staying open later than me.

My evil plan is
working perfectly.

He'll run his employees
into the ground.

And when SpongeBob's mind
finally cracks from exhaustion,

I'll get him to tell me the
secret Krabby Patty formula!

[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

Why aren't you laughing?

I've heard this joke before.

MR. KRABS: All right, everybody!

The Krusty Krab is entering
day three of nonstop service!

Let's give it up for day three!

Yeeha!

Day three!

Krabby Patty, I
don't care if we

have to stay open till the
day after the end of time.

As long as I'm with
you, I'm complete.

Day 10 of nonstop service!

Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?

No one goes home.

Look at these
bags under my eyes.

Even my bags have bags!

[WOMAN SCREAMS]

Quit your
bellyachin', Squidward.

You don't hear SpongeBob
complaining, do ya?

(SINGING) KRABBY
PATTY says I!

You could learn a few
things from that boy.

Mr. Krabs, he is not normal.

[SMOOCHING NOISILY]

All right, you can sit
down for five minutes.

Then it's back to work.

[BODY THUMPS]

Drat!

He's not collapsing
from exhaustion.

But with a little more
pressure, the sponge

will crack like an egg.

Then I'll be there
to feast on the goo

I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.

Could you run that by me again?

Sure.

I said I'm worried that

Mr. Krabs, what's going on?

Everywhere I look, I see

There, there.

I'm sure it's nothing
that getting back to work

won't solve.

Now, here's your spatular.

Spatular.

And here's the grill.

Grill.

And here are some
fresh Krabby

[SCREAMING]

[SCREAM QUIETS]

[SCREAM LOUDENS]

Aah, aah, aah!

Hmm, there may be
a problem after all.

What does this mean?

It means there's something
wrong with your head.

Look, I think maybe you
should see a professional.

Wrestler?

No.

A psychiatrist.

Oh.

But where am I gonna
find a psychiaow!

Hey, look at this.

"Dr. Peter Lankton,
psychiatrist,

specialising in
Krabby Patty phobias.

Gosh, I don't know
about this, Mr. Krabs.

Wouldn't I have to miss
work if I went to see

Well, this looks like the place.

Uh, hello.

Doctor?

PLANKTON: Come in,
Mr. SquarePants.

Please, have a
seat on the couch.

Now, hehheh, let's unload
all that harmful information

in your little yellow head.

You're a bit smaller
than I imagined, Doctor.

But I guess that's why
they call you "shrink."

[CHUCKLES, RIMSHOT]

Do you think there's
hope for me, Doctor?

Hope?

Hope?

When I get my hands
on that formula,

there won't be any
hope for any of ya.

[LAUGHS]

[CLEARS THROAT]

I mean, you'll would
be cured in no time.

Oh, good.

Let's start with
a simple exercise.

Jumping jacks?

I want you to close your eyes.

Tighter.

Tighter.

Too tight!

Now, tell me what you see.

I see giant Krabby Patties!

Good, and what
are they made of?

Hatred.

No, I mean ingredients.

What are the
stinking ingredients?

They're coming for me.

No.

No!

No, stay back!

Wait, where'd you
get that piano?

[SLAM]

[GROANS]

We're trying something else.

I'm going to say
a word, and I want

you to say the first word
that pops into your head.

Ready?

I'm ready!

Work.

Work.

Spatula.

SPONGEBOB: Spatula.

Bun.

SPONGEBOB: Bun.

See, the key is
to say something

different than what I say.

Oh, OK.

I got it.

Potato.

Potahto.

Tomato.

Tomahto.

I've laid out some
words on cards here.

These words are common
kitchen ingredients.

I want you to arrange them
in any order you choose.

It could be a poem
or a secret formula.

I don't know.

Oh, yes.

A secret formula.

Good.

Let's do that.

Um, you're making me nervous.

Oh, OK.

I'll be over here then.

SPONGEBOB: I'm finished.

I arranged them into a piano.

[SLAM]

Since your mind has been
resistant to every mental

technique so far,
I'm forced to resort

to my most powerful
method of curing you.

Fibre?

No.

Hypnosis.

(EXCITEDLY) Hypnosis?

PLANKTON: Now, keep
your eyes on this watch.

When I count to three, you
will fall into a deep sleep.

One.

Atwo.

Athree!

[SNORING]

I can't believe it worked.

Now, when I snap my
fingers, you will

awake and tell me the formula.

[SNAPPING FINGERS]

Hey, wake up.

[CYMBALS CRASH]

[HORN TOOTS]

[DRUM BANGS]

Hmm, what else is
loud and obnoxious?

[RINGTONE CHIMES]

Why won't you wake up?

(SINGING) La, la,
la, la, la la, la.

La, la, la, la, la, la.

Aah!

[BLATHERING ROAR]

[SLURPING]

Where am I?

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

[WHIMPERS]

Hey, SpongeBob.

I heard your brain
was sick, so I

brought you this cookie pizza.

Gee, thanks.

And here's some chocolate milk.

The kind of flavoured
dairy drinks.

Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so
glad we're friend again.

Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll
always be with you right here.

In my heart?

Actually, in your arteries.

Now do me a favour and wake up.

Wake up.

Waaaake uuuuuup!

[MOANS AND YAWNS]

It worked.

I'm cured!

But what about the formula?

Ooh, you're right.

I'd better get back to work.

Thanks for everything, Doc!

No, it's a lie!

Therapy doesn't really work.

You're still sick!

Very, very sick!

Good to see your
brain's all fixed, boy.

Yep, I just needed
some sleep is all.

Well, I can safely say
no more 24hour shifts.

'Cause 23 hours will be plenty!

[LAUGHING]

Oh, Mr. Krabs.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

No, seriously.

Get back to work.

[SEA SHANTY MUSIC]

Easy.

Perfection!

Is number five's order
ready yet, SpongeBob?

Just a second, Squidward.

Well, Krabby Patty, it's
time for you to go now.

[SNIFFLES]

You grew up so fast.

Ioh, I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.

Just take it, Squidward!

Take it away!

[BLUBBERING]

Oh, brother.

Number five.

Number five.

That's me!

Mm!

My compliments to the chef.

[LAUGHING]

Hello, what's this?

[YELPS]

Come out here, boy.

Mr. Krabs?

Wah!

Hush boy, or you'll give away
the location of me hideyhole.

(WHISPERING)
What's a hideyhole?

It's where I hide me treasure.

Whoa!

Catch!

Let's get the chest to
me office, boy, pronto.

What's in this thing?

Treasure?

A treasure trove of sort.

It's me memory chest from
my years in the Navy.

Why'd you dig up
your Navy chest, sir?

Well, my Navy buddies and
I are havin' a reunion.

And I wanted to
wear me old uniform.

[HEAVENLY CHOIR]

SPONGEBOB: Wow, look at
all your cool Navy stuff.

What's that?

Arr, it's me first tattoo.

Neat.

And this is me manly
toughness trophy.

How'd you win that?

By being the
toughest of the tough.

Wow.

Ooh, ooh, who are those guys?

Me shipmates,
the toughest bunch

to ever sail the briny deep.

There's old Iron Eye
and Mutton Chop, me,

Torpedo Belly,
and Lockjaw Jones.

Do you have a cool
nickname, Mr. Krabs?

Of course.

I was old Armour Abs Krabs.

You were?

What do you mean?

Well, I guess you
were thinner back then.

Oh, really?

This is me Navy cadet uniform.

Prepare to eat your words,
'cause I haven't put out more

(STRAINING) than a
couple of pounds.

[RIP]

OK, maybe I'm a bit bigger.

But I'm still the
toughest of the tough.

Go ahead, lad.

Give 'em a punch.

You want me to punch
you in the stomach?

Not in the stomach, lad.

In the armour abs.

Wow.

My entire arm disintegrated.

I still got it.

Now, be a good lad and go get
your station in shipshape.

And leave an old sea dog
to revel in his memories.

Ayeaye, sir!

All right, let's get
this place shipshape.

You men, stop laying around.

To battle stations!

All hands on deck!

[BOSUN'S WHISTLE]

Set course for full flavour!

Ketchup and mustard
off the port bow!

One Krabby Patty
ready to set sail!

MR. KRABS: Noooooo!

Uh, Mr. Krabs?

Hello?

Mr. Krabs?

You all right?

Are you sleepy?

[GASPS]

Mr. Krabs!

[SNIFFING]

I don't smell his pulse.

[GASPS]

What's that?

[CROAKY MOAN]

Is somebody there?

[MOANING]

Don't look at me.

Mr. Krabs?

Leave me be!

You're alive!

And naked.

(CRYING) It's true.

I've moulted.

What's "moulted"?

It's when a crab gets
too fatuh, er, well,

outgrows his shell.

It falls off.

Wow.

Armour Abs Krabs can't
show up at the reunion

like thisall pink
and soft and unmanly.

I'm all flab and no ab.

[SOBS]

SPONGEBOB: Barnacles!

SpongeBob!

Sorry about the foul
language, Mr. Krabs.

But you're acting like there
never was a man in that shell.

The Krabs of his Navy
days was fearless!

He wouldn't let something
as insignificant

as a missing shell
slow him down.

Yeah.

Who cares how silly,
pink, and fleshy you look?

How nonthreatening,
limp, and soggy you are?

[SOBBING]

Howoops.

I can't go anywhere ever again.

(MUTTERING) Stupid
nogood, lousy

Aah!

[SCREAMING]

Wow.

It sure is dark in here.

[GRUNTING]

Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!

SpongeBob, you're a genius!

Well, I'm glad
you got my point.

It's not about what's
on the outside.

It's what's on the in

No, you barnacle brain.

Not your silly metaphor.

You in me shell.

It gives me an idea.

You can go to the reunion
and pretend to be me.

I get to be a Navy buddy?

Course, you'll need some time
to approximate me personality.

Oh, that'll be a snap.

Squidward and I have been doing
it behind your back for years.

[LAUGHS]

All right, show
me what you got.

[CLEARS THROUGH]

(AS MR. KRABS) Look at me.

I'm Mr. Krabs.

I love money.

[CHUCKLES]

Say, that ain't half bad.

I once won a marathon
because someone

dropped a penny in
the finish line.

That's me.

[CHUCKLES]

Every night, I tuck me wallet
in and tell it a bedtime story.

Good night, Wallety.

[SMOOCH]

Yeah.

OK.

I get the point.

Ooh, what's that, you say?

Me daughter, Pearl,
needs an operation?

I'll do it meself
and save a nickel.

[LAUGHING HEARTILY]

That'll do, SpongeBob.

(NORMAL VOICE) Well,
here goes nwow.

I've never seen so
many manly naval men.

So tough.

So brave.

Soclever.

And I'm one of them!

No, you're not.

Don't blow this
for me, SpongeBob.

I won't let you down, sir.

MUTTON CHOP: Armor Abs Krabs!

Come join your old naval
buddies in a toast.

(SINGSONG) Coming!

Oh, what have I done?

(AS MR. KRABS) OK, boys.

Let the SS Party drop
anchor right here.

[BUDDIES CHEERING]

Oh, I've created a monster.

Here's some grog.

You still like pineapple, right?

Like pineapple?

I live in one.

[BUDDIES LAUGHING]

That old Krabs is
as mainly as ever.

I don't believe it.

SpongeBob is pulling it off.

Hey, Armour Abs.

Old Iron Eye has been itchin'
to punch your legendary gut.

Well, if you think
you're man enough.

Uhoh, this could be bad.

Fire the torpedoes!

[GROANING]

What do you say, Krabs?

Just like old time.

A tooth?

Teeth.

Now, that's manly.

[RETCHES]

[ALL GASP]

[ALL CHEER]

He did it!

[MIC FEEDBACK]

All right, me swabbies.

It's time to award the Trophy of
Manly Toughness to a man whose

toughness has stood
the test of time.

That man is Eugene
"Armour Abs" Krabs!

Come up here, Krabs.

This is the best
night of me life.

Me naval buddies
still think I'm manly.

ALL: (CHANTING) Armor abs!

And I didn't have
to shame myself.

Thanks for the

[LAUGHS HEARTILY]

ALL: (CHANTING) Speech!

Speech!

Speech!

[NERVOUS STAMMER]

Say something.

Let me spin you a manly yarn.

Attaboy.

So there I was in
Jellyfish Fields.

I'm doomed.

Me supply of bubble
soap was dangerously low.

And as I blew my last bubble

Did he say Jellyfish Fields?

Blowing bubbles?

Uh, what were you doing
in Jellyfish Fields?

Why, jellyfishing, of course.

ALL: Huh?

Uhuh

(CALLING OUT) Phone

(GRITTING TEETH)
Get off the stage.

Oh.

Uh, well, I gotta go.

Uh, thanks.

Where do you
think you're going?

Everybody knows
there's two things old

Armor Abs Krabs would never do.

Oh, no.

Number one is spend a penny.

And the other one is leave
without giving old Torpedo

Belly when of your worldfamous
steely bellybutts.

Ha ha!

(NORMAL VOICE) Oh, hehheh.

I thought you'd seen my ruse.

(AS MR. KRABS) I mean, arrgh!

You didn't think I was just
gonna collect this here

Trophy of Manly Toughness
without reminding you silly

livers why ya give it to
me in the first place?

Let's have at it.

No holding back.

Give it your all.

I can't watch.

All right, lads.

Take a good look.

This is who I am.

I've moulted me shell,
and I'm vulnerable.

[CRIES]

But I'm certainly no
bubbleblowing jellyfisher.

No offence, SpongeBob.

None taken, Mr. Krabs.

Come on, lad.

Let's go home.

Wait a minute!

You've forgotten something.

I don't understand.

Admittin' you
lost your shell was

the toughest thing
I've ever seen.

And, uh, I have a confession.

Uh

These are fake!

BOTH: Wha?

TORPEDO BELLY: Over here.

MR. KRABS: You
too, Torpedo Belly?

Actually, I had my
torpedo removed long ago?

And these aren't
the same choppers

that I had in the Navy.

My Iron Eye is actually
made of Formica.

[LAUGHTER]

Look at that, Mr. Krabs.

Your Navy buddies all
had something to hide.

Yeah.

Poor suckers.

At least my shell
will grow back.

The Krusty Krab is closed!

You mean I got out of bed
for nothing?

The doors are locked

the doors are locked
and we are on the outside!

Outsiders.

What are we going to do Squidward?

There are Krabby Patties inside
all alone.

KRABS:
Just stand aside, lad,

and let me unlock the door.

Mr. Krabs, you're here!

Gosh, Mr. Krabs,
we were worried

something might have
happened to you.

World would've been deprived of
the greatest food
known to man.

Oh, you made me
drop me keys.

Give me some space, lad!

Can't I get a little space?!

I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.

Harsh.

[ laughing]

Argh! Me back!

Are you hurt,
Mr. Krabs?

No, I'm just doubled over
in pain

fighting back tears in me eyes
because it's a new dance craze!

Oh, I thought
you were hurt.

I am hurt, you idiot!

I'm sorry I snapped
at you, laddie.

It's just me back
is killing me.

It's me old lumpy mattress

it's like trying to sleep
on broken coral.

I'm going out of me mind.

Ouch! Oh, me back.

[ grumbling]

Poor Mr. Krabs.

What are we going to do,
Squidward?

Why do anything?

I like the new Mr. Krabs

he yells at you more.

[ laughing]

I'm serious, Squidward.

So am I. We should get him
a new mattress

and surprise him
with it as a gift !

Then we'll never have to
be late to work again.

What?!

You want me to spend
my hardearned money

on my richerthanme
skinflint boss?

No, thank you.

That's okay, Squidward!

You'll warm up to the idea.

Thanks for coming
with me, Patrick.

No problem, buddy.

I always wanted to go
to a mattress store.

Wow!
Wow!

I've never seen
so many mattresses.

Yeah.

How many do you think
there are?

Ten.

Cool. There's plenty more
than that.

Try 'em out
find one you like.

What are you morons doing?!

Making a card for Mr. Krabs.

To go with his new mattress.

Oh, I see, you're just
kissing up to the boss

to make me look bad!

Well, I won't stand for it!

Give me that card!

Hmm! Trying to outsmart me,
will you?

Haha!

There, I signed it
for all of us.

Hey, you didn't even help pay.

Oh, that's okay.

As long as Mr. Krabs is happy.

KRABS:
Oh, me back!

Well, here goes
another useless attempt

to sleep on me mountainous,
lumpy mattress.

Argh!

[ groaning]

That's queerme mattress seems
strangely cozy

and... butter... like.

[ snoring]

ALL:
Surprise!

Armageddon! What?
You? Oh! You?

What in a blueeyed scallop
are you doing in me bedroom?

We noticed how miserable
you were

on your lumpy, old mattress...

So Isuggested
we get you a new one.

I thought it was
your idea.

So, where's
me old mattress then?[ steam whistling]

Don't worry, I took care of that
personally, too.

I had it hauled away
to the dump.

[ Krabs shouting]

All... my... money
was in that mattress!

What?! Haven't you ever heard of
a bank?!

No!

[ groaning, babbling]

Mr. Krabs!

No...!

And we got you
a card.

Is there money in it?
Nope.

[ groans]

[ siren wailing]

[ tires squeal]

SPONGEBOB:
Is it serious, Doctor?

Will Mr. Krabs
be all right?

Mr. Krabs is in a cashcoma.

Only the return of his money
can save his life.

It was
SpongeBob's fault!

Getting Mr. Krabs
a new mattress
was hisidea!

I knew it!

Not so fast!

This card says, "This was all
my idea! Love, Squidward."

If Mr. Krabs doesn't
pull through,

you're going to jail.

Oh... you did this,
SquarePants!

If you don't get
Mr. Krabs' mattress back,

I am going to mur...

[ policeman clears throat]

[ laughing nervously]

Help you do it myself.

Wow, he really does care.

PATRICK:
What a dump.

[ gate rattling]

We've got to get
in there, Squidward.

Mr. Krabs is counting on us.

PATRICK:
SpongeBob, isn't that

the mattress over there?

Terrific, Patrick,
you found it!

What? Where? Let me see!

Over there, Squidward,

underneath that really big
guard worm.

[ worm growling, snoring]

Oh, that figures.

Oh, no! This is horrible.

What is it, Doctor?

This man has no insurance.

He'll never be able
to afford this room.

You're right, nurse.

Extract the patient to the hallway, stat!

[ Krabs groaning]

SPONGEBOB:
Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress
all right. Let's go get it.

Okay, here's the plan:

You two quietly go in there,

remove the mattress
out from under the guard worm

without "waking the worm."

Why not?

Because that would
be rude, Patrick.

And nothing's meaner
than a junkyard worm.

He'll eat you alive!

Hey, wait a minute.

What are you going to do?

Oh, I've got
the most important job.

I'm going to keep watch
to make sure it's safe.

Gee, thanks, buddy.

My pleasure.

Now let's get
a move on.

[ laughing]

[ panting]

Ah, isn't it beautiful,
Patrick?

SPONGEBOB:
You can see everything
from up here.

PATRICK:
Wow! [ sighs]

What are you morons doing?

Hey, Patrick, I think
I can see our houses
from here.

PATRICK:
Where? I can't see 'em.

[ all shouting]

Wow!
Wow!

[ laughing]

Let's do it again!

What did you idiots do?

Squidward, what are you doing
in there?

You were supposed to keep watch!

Yeah, and you woke up
the guard worm, too!

I didn't do it!

You blockheads woke...[ worm growling]

the... worm.

[ Squidward screaming,
fabric tearing, worm growling]

DOCTOR:
Doctor?

DOCTOR 2:
Yes, Doctor.

Regarding your patient,
I have come to this conclusion.

Yes, go on.
!
We have to remove him

from in front of
the candy machine

so I can get to
the NuttyNut Bar.

Of course.
Nurse!

I'm on it.

[ Krabs groaning]

Worm Bait to Retriever,

Worm Bait to Retriever,
we're in.

Out. Retriever to Worm Bait,

stay in,don't go out.

Understood. Out.

No, in! Out.

Understood. Out.

SQUIDWARD:
You're on the far side
of the dump? right ?

Affirmative.
Good, then make lots of noise

to draw the guard worm

away from the mattress
so I can retrieve it.

Affirmative. Out.

Oh, that's why he calls
himself the Retriever.

Why are we called
Worm Bait? I don't know.

[ ululating] Oh, yeah.

[ both ululating]

Great idea, Patrick!

[ ululating and banging]

[ growling]

And my perfect plan
falls into place.

[ laughing]

[ ululating and banging]

Uh, SpongeBob?
Yes, Patrick?

I think I know why
our code name
is Worm Bait.

[ growling]

[ stammering]:
Nice worm.

Good, kind, gentle worm.

[ snarling]

Ooh!

[ panting happily]

Oh, SpongeBob,
he likes your wooden spoon.

Huh?

Wow, I think
you're right, Patrick.

See if he plays catch!

Okay.

See the stick, boy.
Go get it, boy!

[ barks]

Coast is clear.

Squiddy, you are a genius.

Ouch! What the...?

Hey, I needed a wooden spoon.

I'll just keep it safe from harm
in my back pocket.

And now for the mattress.

[ fabric rips,
Squidward grunts]

I should have guessed.

[ Squidward screaming]

Excuse me, Doctor.

Administrator,
what can I do for you?

It has come to my attention

that your patient, Mr. Krabs,
is out on the front sidewalk.

Yes. Yes, he is.

What were
you thinking, man?

We're trying to run
a business.

We can't leave patients
on the sidewalk.

Not to worry. Nurse!

I'm on it.

Alright you two, what's the holdup?!

SPONGEBOB:
We feel silly!

Come on, do it
for old man Krabs.

SPONGEBOB:
Okay.

Can you explain the plan again Squidward?

Sure, but first,
put on this cologne.

Steak sauce?

Okay, so you two are dressed
as choice cuts.

You go in there

and yell
"Trick or treat!"

The worm will realize he forgot
to stock up on Halloween candy,

he'll leave to buy some,
then we take the mattress.

Give me that cologne.

Now get in there!

SPONGEBOB:
Happy Halloween Squidward!

I am not going to get hurt
this time.

[ rattling]

What the...?

Isn't that Mr. Krabs?

[ screaming]

[ growling]

That guard worm
doesn't look very happy.

Run, Mr. Krabs!

Run like you're not in a coma!

[ sniffing] [ growling]

It's... me money!

[ snarling]

[ growling] [ worm yelps]

Oh, money! I promise I'll never leave
you alone again.

Hey, Mr. Krabs. [ barking]

No, Mr. Krabs, it's us.

Trick or treat.

Oh, hey, SpongeBob.

I didn't recognize you.

Say, why are you two
dressed as meat?

Not just meat
we're choice cuts. Right, Squidward?

Oh, I give up.

[ worm snarling] [ screaming]

[ screaming and shouting]

[ clam crowing like a rooster]

[ sound like cloth tearing]

And so passes
another sleepless night

haunted by my inability to steal
even a single Krabby Patty.

Maybe today will be
the day.

Thank you for
your patronizing words,

computer wife.

Do you even have a plan?

Plan, schman
I'm going to wing it.

What's the worst thing
that could happen?

I'm in.

That was easy.

Maybe today is the day

I'm going to steal
the Krabby Patty formula...

[ screaming]

Careful,
I just mopped there.

[ groans]

Look at you, Plankton,

Once again you've fallen
flat on your back

in another pathetic attempt
to steal me formula.

Though you tried
and tried,

you haven't had
the smallest nibble

of my delicious formula.

And you never will!

[ laughing]

How do you sleep at night

knowing you're
a complete failure?

There really should be
a "Wet Floor" sign.

Yeah, if that were me
who slipped,

I'd sue old man Krabs

for all
he's got.

Does that include
the Krabby Patty formula?

Of course.

Oh, the pain!

I can't feel my arms and legs!

I think they're broken.

I'll have to sue
for my pain and suffering.

Sue?!

Oh, that looks bad.

Uhoh.

Poor little man.

Hold up a second!

Plankton, we don't need
to drag this little incident

into court, do we?
Well...

if you transfer
the Krabby Patty formula to me,

I'll forget
your gross negligence.

Scoundrel!

You'll have my formula

when you pry it
from me lifeless claws!

[ laughing sinisterly]

See you in court, Krabs!

Uh, I mean...

Oh, the pain!

The deep frying
pain!

I'm in a blue ruin.

I'm doomed.

Don't worry, Mr. Krabs,
I will do whatever it takes

to keep the Krusty Krab formula

from getting into
Plankton's evil hands.

What I really need is
a good lawyer.

Hello, did somebody
say "lawyer"?

Richard A. Bottomfeeder,
Attorney At Law.

I couldn't help but notice
that despicable display.

So, uh, how much is this
going to cost me?

Actually, I won't charge you
a dime unless we win.

[ cash register dings]

In fact, I think
we should counter sue

for everything Plankton owns.

[ cash register dings]

[ clanking]

Does that happen a lot ?
No, they're usually silver.

[ humming]

Mr. Krabs?

What is it, lad?

I thought you might want to hear
my testimony

for when you call me
as a character witness?

I've been rehearsing it.

Actually, SpongeBob,

we won't be needing
any testimony from you.

Why, you'd be
more of a...

[ whispering]

of a liability
than an asset.

But I...

Now, run along

make things shipshape
for my victory celebration.

I've got to get
to the courthouse.

There's only a few
free parking places.

Oh, this is going to be
a slam dunk...

[ screams]

Oh, no!

Mr. Krabs's lawyer! Speak to me!

Wracked with pain...

Can't move...

But what about
Mr. Krabs's case?

Looks like you're going to have
to handle this one, son.

But I'm a...

a liability.

Everything
you need to win...

[ gasping]

is in this here case.

Really?
Everything?

Uhhuh, everything but a suit.

A suit. Wonder where I could get a suit.

[ The People's Court
theme music plays]

I'll give you one last chance.

I'll drop the charges
if you give me the formula.

Never, you little whelp!

[ crowd gasps]

Ow, ow, my wittle arm!

[ crowd gasps]

What? No, I didn't
lay a claw on him.

Ow... my other arm!

[ crowd gasps] He's lying!

Bah!

Court will come
to order.

The Honorable
Judge Tickleback
presiding.

Mr. Krabs, where is
your attorney?

I don't know
where he could be.

[ crashing]

Here I am!

Thank you for joining us,
Mister...

SpongeBob Lawyerpants,
Your Honor.

[ softly]:
What are you doing here,
SpongeBob?

Your lawyer, uh,
fell down on the job.

But don't worry, Mr. Krabs,
I have everything under control.

It's, uh, all in here.

Really?

Yup, right
in... here...

Is there a problem?

Uh, your lawyer didn't give me
the combination.

Is the plaintiff
ready to proceed?

Yes, Your Honor, I'll try.

Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

I wasn't always
the tortured shell of a protozoa

that writhes in pain
before you today.

I... was a vibrant carefree,
happygolucky single cell.

Pull yourself
together, boy.

Then came the fateful day
that I paid an innocent visit

to the deathtrap
known as the Krusty Krab.

How's it coming, lad?

Don't worry, Mr. Krabs,
I'm on the case.

Upon entering
said establishment,

I found myself
without any warning

slipping and finally falling
onto a hard, unforgiving floor

that had been
intentionally covered

with a vicious fluid.

Bombs away!

[ metal rattling]

PLANKTON:
Ahem!

Are you quite finished?

Mmhmm.

Where was I? Oh, yeah.

But the worst part is...

my dreams of completing
a marathon,

like I promised my old Grammy,
have been dashed.

[ sobbing]

I'm sorry, GramGram!

[ sobbing] Sorry!

[ all sobbing]

Thank you for your
kind attention.

[ softly]:
Suckers.

Does the defense [ sobs] have
an opening statement?

Yes, Your Honor.

Poor GramGram!

Mr. Krabs, can you
identify this item?

KRABS:
It's a "Wet Floor" sign.

Do you own one?

Uh, well... um...

No, I don't.

[ jurors gasp]

No, no, you don't understand!

I had to make some tough
business decisions

and the sign seemed...
superfluous.

[ jurors murmuring "guilty"]

No more questions.

JUDGE:
Your witness,
Mr. Lawyerpants.

Huh?

Sometime today, Mr. Pants.

May it please the court, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

my client has been called
"cheap," "miserly,"

and "chronically
tightfisted."

Uh... um...

But if he were as cheap
as the prosecution claims he is,

would he be able
to sit there quietly

while I took out a dollar and
dropped it in the blender?

[ gasps]

[ blender whirring]

No! No! No!

Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

Daddy's here.

[ murmuring in disgust]

Uh...

A little glue,
a little tape

you'll be right
as rain.

Daddy didn't forget you.

Uh...

Does the defense have
any witness to call?

Yes, Your Honor.

Defense calls...

Squidward to the stand.

Ah, Squidward,
a loyal employee.

SPONGEBOB:
Mister, uh,
Squidward is it?

My client
has been called
"cheap."

Would you agree with
that ludicrous statement?

Yes.
What?!

Allow me to rephrase the question.

Can you tell the court
of some instance

of Mr. Krabs's generosity
in any way?

Nope. Can I go now?

One day off in three years and
I have to spend it testifying?

[ jurors gasp;
murmur in disgust]

Must... open... case.

So, it was you who made
the floor slippery, wasn't it?

Answer the question!

Need I remind you
you are under oath?

I'm doomed.

You may as well give up
on that case, me boy,

my goose is cooked.

[ gasps]

Mr. Krabs,
I'm surprised at you.

We can't give up just because
things look bleak.

This trial will be won
by what's in your heart,

not what's in
this dumb old case.

It's open.

It's...

It's just
his lunch.

Or is it?

Defense calls Plankton
to the stand.

Why did you go into
the Krusty Krab that day?

To, you know, say hello to
my oncegoodfriend, Mr. Krabs.

What?

Are you sure it wasn't
to make off

with one of these?!

[ sniffing]

Gotcha.

Weren't you there
to steal the formula

of the most delicious,
sweetsmelling sandwich

known to Bikini Bottom?

Krabby Patty...

[ groaning]

I can't take it!

Give me!

Give me!
Give me!
Give me!

Yippee!

Finally it's mine!

KRABS:
I'll take that.

Huh?

No! No! No!

Once again, Plankton,

the sweetest
of life's joys

has eluded
your grasp.

No! No! No! No!

Has the jury reached a verdict?

We have, Your Honor.

We find the defendant...

not guilty!

But he is cheap.

Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not
to accept your help

from the beginning.

That's okay, Mr. Krabs.

I made you a present.

A present for me?

Close your eyes
and hold out your hand.

[ groans in pain]

SPONGEBOB:
It's a "Wet Floor" sign. I made it myself.

Well, it'll do.

After all, it's free.

Hi, SpongeBob.

Hey, Patrick.

What are you doing?

Carrying this heavy bag
of snail food for Gary.

How is Gary?

He's fine.

Uh, Pat, can we talk about
this some other time?

This snail food is
really heavy.

Oh, sure,

but there was something
I wanted to tell you...

something important.

Oh, I remember.

Uh...

Who was I talking to?

Ahoy, Captain,
what have we here?

It's a tiny form letter.

"Dear Sir or Ma'am:

"We are sorry we missed you.

"We will attempt to redeliver

at our earliest convenience."

[ doorbell rings]

Hello... [ gasps]

My package!

Whoopee!

My official Mermaid Man and

with you right now.

Mermaid Man needs me.

[ Gary meows]

Gary, please!

I'm trying to defeat
the Dirty Bubble!

[ meows]

So, let's get this
straight, Gary.

You don't want me to defeat
the Dirty Bubble.

You know, Dirty Bubble
terror of the seven seas,

arch nemesis
of my favorite TV superheroes,

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,

and apparently renowned
paddleball champion.

[ evil laughter]

Well, I, for one, recognize

the importance
of this undertaking.

But whether or not you do
remains to be seen.

Now, if you don't mind,
I would like to get back to it.

Petssometimes I wonder

if they understand
a word you're saying.

[ screaming]

Gary, I hate it
when you do that.

Now, get!

And leave your master
to his important affairs.

I won.

But then I lost

That's terrible!

Keep shaking, Patrick.

Oh.

[ jiggling]
Gary!

What are those
Neanderthals up to?

Don't they know I'm busy
spoiling myself?

[ screaming]

[ panting]

You check over there.

I'll check in here.

Find him yet, Pat?

No, but I'll keep looking.

But there's nowhere left
to look.

There's one place
we haven't checked.

I doubt Gary
could fit in there.

Can't hurt to look.

Here goes nothing.

Look, Pat.

What is it?

Let's see.

"Dear SpongeBob,

"These last few years have been
some of the best of my life,

"but I must move on.

"Don't bother
to come looking for me.

"By now I have probably found a
new owner who actually remembers

"to fill up my food bowl
every now and again.

Sincerely, Garyat least
until my new owner renames me."

Dear Neptune,
what have I done?

What do you mean?

You drove him away.

It's right there
in black and white.

See? Right there.

And there.

Gary.

[ couple chuckling]

Are my pants
too high, dear?

[ couple chuckling]

[ flies buzzing]

[ hissing]

[ hissing]

[ all hissing]

Look who came
to dinner.

Guess he didn't
like nachos.

[ all groan]

There you are.

There you are,
Miss Tuffsy.

Oh, Gramma
finally found you.

She was starting
to get worried.

Now, let's get you
home, Miss Tuffsy,

and get you
something to eat.

Hmm...[ clanking]

You feel much lighter
than Gramma remembers.

There you go,
Miss Tuffsy.

Gramma knows you like
your Mr. Heatee

set to "Extra Cozy"
when you're home
relaxing.

Mmm.

Goodness, you're almost
out of cookies!

Here, I'll go
and get some more.

Now, don't you go
running off again.

Mmm.[ chewing noisily]

There we go.

After this I'll make up

some of those deviled eggs
I promised.

Oh, how about
a little music?

Gramma's got
a killer stereo system.

[ music warbling faster 
as Gramma cranks]

[ slow music begins]

[ slow big band jazz playing]

Oh, this song reminds Gramma
of her days as a riveter.

[ slow big band music playing]

You make Gramma feel
so young.

Come on, Miss Tuffsy,
let's do the boogiewoogie.

[ loud crack]Ooh!

Okay, oh, that's enough
of the boogiewoogie for now.

SPONGEBOB:
Gary!

Gary?

Gary!

Gary!

[ tires squeal, 
SpongeBob coughing]

Gary...!

[ wailing]:
Oh... Gary!

[ dramatic music playing on TV]

Gramma knows how much you love

these latenight
crime drama programs.

Don't you, Miss Tuffsy?

Oh, heavens, look at the time.

It's time for bed,
Miss Tuffsy.

[ meows sadly]

Quiet, Gary!

Can't you see I'm busy?!

[ blows raspberry]

Here's your room,
Miss Tuffsy.

[ meows questioningly]

Here you are, darling.

Let Gramma tuck you in.

There you go.

Oh, I almost forgot
your goodnight kiss.

[ lips squeaking 
as they pucker]

Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy.

[ claps twice]

SpongeBob!

You're 15 minutes late!

Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night

looking for Gary.

You see, he ran away
and, well, now I...

SpongeBob, are you okay?

You look kind of...
different.

Well, I'm not exactly
what you'd call okay,
Mr. Krabs.

You see, my...

Aha!

You just forgot
to put your hat on.

Knew I'd figure it out.

[ patty sizzling]

[ SpongeBob weeping, 
tears sizzling]

[ blubbering]

Gary.

Yeah, I'd like a refund
for this Krabby Patty.

Refund?!

What's wrong with it?!

Oh, nothing, really,
except that it's
covered in tears!

What the...?

Gary...

[ fighting back tears]

SpongeBob!

There's customers out there,
boy, waiting to be fed!

This wouldn't be the first time

I disappointed someone
who was hungry.

Okay, boy,
why don't you

tell Mr. Krabs
what's wrong.

Well, you see...

That's enough, boy.

See, it's not always
what you say that matters.

Sometimes it's
what you don't say.

Understand?

Yes, Mr. Krabs.

I should have told Gary
how important he was to me.

I don't know
what that has to do

with making Krabby Patties,
but I do know this:

Any problem you have
can be solved

with a little
hard work.

You're right,
Mr. Krabs!

That's me boy!

If I'm going to find Gary,

I'm going to need
to work harder at it.

Wha...?

[ snoring loudly, mumbling]

It's the apocalypse!

Office products falling
from the sky!

No, Patrick.

We're going to use
this stuff to go find Gary.

But I thought you
drove him away

with your neglect
and indifference.

[ sighs]

Patrick, now is not the time
for talking.

We've got work to do.

[ squishing]

There you go, Miss Tuffsy
fresh squeezed.

It takes a little longer
to make it that way,

but it was a labor of love.

[ meows]

How about
a little more syrup

on those pancakes?

Here comes the train.

Hoohoo!

Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy.

[ engine revving]

[ tires squealing]

GRAMMA:
Oh, here we are.

[ bell on door jingles]

[ panting]

Here's a good spot.

SPONGEBOB:
"Gary! I am sorry!

"Please come home!

Love, SpongeBob."

Quick, hand me the tape.

Hey, they're having a sale
on scented pine cones!

Patrick, this is
no time for that.

[ shop bell jingles]

[ sighs]

Pine cones,
pine cones, pine cones.

These pipe cleaners
are simply delightful.

Old lady, quick

I'm looking for
the scented pine cones.

It's an emergency!

Well, I hope
you weren't

looking to buy
them, sonny,

because Gramma already
picked up all they had.

Once again, you and I
are kept apart,

O sweetscented
pine cones.

Hey, Gary.

There.

[ signs ripping]

Um... uh...

Come on, Pat,

just take these flyers
and hand them out.

Come on, Miss Tuffsy,

there's plenty more fun
to be had.

Gramma will get a lovely

[ meows]

Don't worry,
it's no trouble at all.

Easy to do.

[ sniffs, meows]

Oh, Miss Tuffsy,
do you have to go potty?

Here, why don't you use
this stack of flyers

given to me today
by a little chubby boy.

[ Gary imagines meow]

Gary, please come back to me!

Go, boy, go!

[ Gramma whistles]

You stay right there.

The meat loaf is almost done.

[ groans]

GRAMMA:
Oh, dear.

Oh, the meat loaf's
not quite ready yet,

but Gramma knows how hungry
you are, Miss Tuffsy,

so she whipped up
a quick batch of cookies.

[ leather creaking]

SNAILS:
Run!

[ straining]

You don't want cookies?

Don't fretI made a batch
of deviled eggs, too.

Come back, Miss Tuffsy.

You don't want these
to go to waste, do you?

They were a labor of love.

GRAMMA:
Oh, don't worry,
Miss Tuffsy,

Gramma will find you.

SNAIL:
Hey!

You're that guy
that doesn't like nachos.

[ in singsong]:
Miss Tuffsy...

I know you're back there.

I can hear
your stomach growling.

Hey!

GRAMMA:
Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.

Who?

GRAMMA:
You must be starving.

[ sighs deeply]

[ SpongeBob sobbing]

Just let it
out, buddy.

That's right.

I can't cry
any more, Patrick.

When Gary left, he took
all my tears with him.

Did you just say "Gary"?

SpongeBob!

I... I just remembered.

Earlier today
at the craft store,

I saw... these huge chunks
of balsa wood!

They were awesome!

Gary loved
balsa wood!

[ blubbering]

I got to try to forget Gary.

For some reason,
I can't get him out of my mind.

I blew itI really blew it.

I took you for granted,
Gary, I'm sorry!

Don't just stare at me
say something!

I'm talking to a billboard.

[ meows]

Now I'm hearing things.

If only I could see you
one more time

so I could tell you
how much I love you.

If only I could hear you meow
one last time.

[ Gary meows]

[ sniffling]:
Yeah, like that.

[ Gary purring]

Gary, your purring
is making it hard to forget you.

Gary!

Oh, Gary!

So, did you hear any of that,
or do I have to repeat myself?

[ meows]

Okay, good.

I promise, Gary,

things are going
to be different

between you and I.

You'll see, pal.

Now, let's go home
and get you something to eat.

You must be starving.

Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit
wants to come in before we open.

What? Guy in a suit?

No! It's a tax collector!

Hide us, SpongeBob!

KRABS [ muffled]:
Now we'll walk nonchalantly
to the rear exit.

He's got a card.

"R.A. PennyPincher
Vending Supplies."

KRABS:
What?!

My machine has arrived?!

Ooh, let him in,
let him in, let him in!

Bring it in, boys.

That's it, set her down easy.

Here are the keys,
Mr. Krabs.

Happy vending!

What is it?

Only the greatest
moneymaker

since the Krabby Patty.

Gentlemen, meet
"Skill Crane"!

[ dazed]:
Ooh... Skill Crane.

At a quarter a pop,

this thing will pay for itself
in no time.

Which reminds me
step up, boys.

First one's free.

Thanks, Mr. Krabs.

No, thanks, I'll pass.

Come on, Squidward,
you know you want to.

[ sighing]:
Okay.

If you insist.

Thanks.

Squidward!

In the machine!

All right, all right.

[ in bored monotone]:
Oh, boy, what fun.

You lose!

Did you see that, SpongeBob?!

I almost got that

Well, why don't
I give it a try?

Good luck. You'll never...

Wow, Squidward,
you flipped

That takes an awful

Well, thank you for saying so.

he's getting lonely.

Don't worry, Barry,

I'll get you a friend.

Ha! If you think

you're going to win again...

Winner!

There you go, Barry!

Oh, I loosened
that one up for you.

You would have never won
that without myskill.

of turning your paycheck
into quarters

do laundry or buy a soda

or... something.[ change jingling]

then I close my eyes.

Close your eyes?

I'm being the crane.

Oh, that's ludi...

See? Now you try.

This is ridiculous.

If I close my eyes,
how will I know
where...

Do you want to win or not?

Okay.

Squidward,
put your quarter in.

But this is
my last quarter.

Funny, last time I checked,
you were a cashier.

You're yucking

I'll try to remember that.

You didn't win

It means...

you have no skills
and you're a loser!

I'm a winner,
see my prize.

You're a loser
who sits and cries.

Ow, ow, ow, ow,

Did you see how
I handled that crane?

I sure did.

I think I have
the magic touch.

Uhhuh.

I just closed my eyes

and became the crane.

[ bored]:
Oh, yeah,
you're the man.

SpongeBob, look.

Uh, Squidward, I don't think
the same principles apply.

Be the crane.

Wait, Squidward!

Be the crane.

He did it!

Yay, Squidward!

Yeah,
that's Squidward.

He's got

don't be the crane!

Good morning,
Squidward!

SpongeBob, what are
you doing in my house?

I came to make sure
you don't oversleep
and miss work.

Oh, gee, SpongeBob,

that's very thoughtful
of you.

My pleasure, Squidward.

That's what good
neighbors are for.

You did overlook one
teensy, little detail, however.

What's that, Squidward?

It's Sunday!

A good neighbor doesn't
bother me on Sunday!

Sunday!

No wonder Squidward's grumpy.

He forgot his Sunday papers.

This will show Squidward
I'm a good neighbor.

I'll bring it to him.

[ grunting]

Man, this is heavy!

Oh! Pardon me.

Hey, watch where
you're going!

[ screams]

A newspaper monster!

[ screams]:
Aah, monster!

Will you two nincompoops
kindly quiet down?!

I am not going to let them ruin
the rest of my Sunday.

[ humming]

Let's see, pillow, placed just
so for slight foot elevation...

flower to brighten the room...

flower fragrance...

[ sighs]

And the final touch...

[ touch tones beeping]

Yes, I'd like to order
the Sunday special.

Yes, the pedicure
andfootmassage house call,

that is correct.

See you at 4:00, my good man.

This is going to be
a heavenly day.

Oh, I almost forgot.

Bonbon.

Hello there,
heaven's little wonder.

Take me on a chocolate vacation.

[ Patrick and SpongeBob 
whoop like sirens]

Om...Om...

Om...

Om...

BOTH:
By the allseeing eye,

ye are worthy,
we are not.

What are you
two idiots doing?

Secret ritual.

To inaugurate you
as president.

Me? President of Bikini Bottom?

I knew the people would come
to their senses.

No, silly

not the president
of Bikini Bottom.

Even better.

Better?

You're the president

of the Secret Royal Order
of the Good Neighbor Lodge.

The what?

Is this some
stupid club
you two made up?

Oh!
Oh!

[ both giggle]

Maybe.

[ both giggle]

It's a secret.

[ both laugh]

Fine!

As my first presidential
decree, uh...

why don't you, uh,

go out and paint
all the leaves
on the trees

to make the neighborhood
look nicer.

Now, out, out,
out, out, out.

That'll keep 'em busy
for a few Sundays.

What color should we
paint the leaves?

Aah! Polka dots.

Now, don't
bother me anymore.

BOTH:
Wow, polka dots!

Our new president
is a genius.

Yeah.

[ both laugh]

BOTH:
See you later, Squidward.

Whenever you're
ready, Patrick.

Hold still, buddy.

Okay, Pat, give me
a quick shake.

Okeydokey.

Okay, I'm ready!

Hey, that worked
perfectly.

Come on,
good neighbor Patrick.

Let's paint
the town polkadot.

[ clock chiming]

Oh, no, it's already noon.

I will be darned
if I let those morons

eat up any more
of my valuable Sunday.

SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK:
Good neighbors are we.

Lalalalala.

What's going on
out there?

Hi, President Squidward.

Almost done painting...

[ screams]
My eyes!

[ screaming]

Look out!

[ shrieks]

[ brakes screech]

Oh, your poor man.

You must be very sick.

Let us take you
to the hospital.

No, really,
I'm fine,
please.

No. I'm fine.

[ tires screech]

BOTH:
See you later, neighbor.

It isa lovely day

for a ride
in the country.

Yeah. Our president
sure knows how to live.

I would like
to call this meeting

of the Good Neighbor Lodge
to order.

Let's begin with roll call.

Patrick.

[ snoring]

Okay.

Squidward?

Squidward?

Squidward, you home?

Did you find him,
SpongeBob?

Nope. I guess
he's still on
his Sunday drive.

Or maybe he's on
a secret mission.

I hope he's not
in danger.

Danger?!

As members of the
Good Neighbor Lodge,

we are sworn to protect
our presidentefrom danger.

Excuse me.

Somebody ordered a relaxing
pedicure and foot massage:

the Sunday special.

We better check
this guy out,

make sure he's safe
for Squidward.

At least I still have my Sunday
pedicure to look forward to.

[ SpongeBob and Patrick 
giggling]

What are you two
doing in my house?

We're checking
to make sure

this guy really
is a certified
foot masseur

and not some kind
of assassin.

Well, I say
he checks out aokay.

Squidward, have
you ever seen more
lovely French tips?

French tips,
huh?

All right, pal, make with a
relaxing foot massage, pronto!

Uhoh. Uh, sorry,
your hour's up.

All right, you two, out!

Don't even think about dragging
your empty skulls around here

for the rest of the day

or tomorrow
or next week!

Does that include...

Yes, it does!

Gee, Patrick,
do you think

Squidward was trying
to tell us something?

Yes, I was!

Youcall yourselves
good neighbors?

You're the worst
neighbors ever!

You don't deserve
to wear those fezzes!

Gee, Pat, maybe
President Squidward's right.

Yeah.

I guess we aren't good
neighbors after all.

No, you aren't!

You're horrible neighbors!

[ hyperventilates]

And stop calling me
president!

Come on, let's go.

There are only three hours
of my Sunday left.

They took it all away.

I didn't even get to read
the Sunday paper.

[ snarling]

Good neighbors, my right...

Hello.

Run for your lives!

[ Squidward shouts]

What the...

What are you doing?!

Huh?

I only have half an hour
of metime left

and the idiots took my house.

Which means those boobs
aren't around to bug me.

Ooh, just what
I've been waiting for.

[ laughing hysterically]

Iam going to relax,
if it kills me.

Ah!

[ crowd screaming]

Fire!

Whoa, Squidward's house is
destroying the neighborhood.

We got to turn
this thing off.

Nope, not it.

[ toilet flushes]
Nope.

Nope.

That's not it, either.

This Sunday relaxation
really hits the spot.

Hmm, where to look?

Hmm, this "off" button
seems suspicious.

We did it, Patrick!

President Squidward...

No, no. Don't
say anything more.

This was all my fault.

I was the one
who wanted to relax on Sunday.

Now, if you'll be so kind
as to leave,

so I can get ready
for work tomorrow.

Mr. President...

Shush.

But we just
wanted to...

Get out of my house!

Huh?

There
he is!

Are you the owner
of this house?

Yes! Yes, I am!

Then on behalf

of the citizens
of Bikini Bottom,

I present you
with this summons

to pay for the destruction
of our town.

You'll be doing community
service every Sunday

for the rest of your life.

Huh?

Squidward, you got
one of those, too?

This will be great

the three of us cleaning up
Bikini Bottom.

Well, see you next Sunday,
President Squidward.

Money, oh, money,

Chaching, chaching,

There's only one thing

Ahoy there,
matey.

Can I help
you gentlemen?

Are you the owner?

Who wants
to know?

Allow me to introduce myself.

Howard Blandy, President,
Blandy Franchising Company.

Howard Blandy!

You mean the
Howard Blandy?

The Howard Blandy
that masterminded

the ruthless takeover of every
small, familyowned business

in Bikini Bottom?

ThatHoward Blandy?

I worship you!

[ sobbing]

Get it together
a little, man.

Sorry, it's just that...
you're rich.

I'm Mr. Krabs.

To what do I owe
the honor

of having you here,
Howard?

What would it take
to buy the Krusty Krab?

Buy the Krusty Krab?!

It's not for sale.

You know,
I may not make as much

as your fancyschmancy
mega restaurant chain,

but it's the blood, sweat
and tears of a hard day's work.

It's not about the...

Holy sweet mother of pearl!

I like the way you think,
Blandy.

But it'll take
a lot more

than a suitcase
full of cash

to buy the Krusty
Krab from me.

Oh, there's
a lot more than that.

The rest is over there.

Jumping King Neptune!

Soldgive
me my money.

First, sign this contract.

You relinquish the Krusty Krab
and all ownership thereof

along with its employees,
merchandise, logos

and cash registers.

I still get the money?Yes.

That'll be fine then.

Here you go.

Now, give me,
give me!

Whooha!

See you 'round!

What's happening?

Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs, they're putting up
pennants in the Krusty Krab.

What's going on?

I'm retiring!

Retiring?

I'm free to do whatever I want.

I can learn how to ride
that bicycle I got 30 years ago.

Or go to the new hook museum
downtown.

Or ever paint bowls of fruit.

Aren't you
happy for me?

I sure am.

So long, boys!

Have fun, Mr. Krabs.

Heaven knows
I won't.

Hi, gentlemen.

I'm Carl,
your new manager.

New manager?

I think you'll find
working at the Krabby O'Mondays

to be both a learning experience
and an enjoyable one.

Krabby O'Mondays?

You won't need
these anymore.

Now, here are
your new uniforms

and here are the...

employee manuals.

See you
first thing tomorrow.

[ straining]

[ engine sputtering]

[ sniffing]

Ah...

The sweet smell
of a brand new day!

First stop, the new hook museum.

Then maybe I'll...

Hey... the Krabby O'Mondays?

Not the name I would've chosen.

But that's all behind me now.

Oh, really?

Really.

Oh.

Dad, isn't there something

you need to do?!

Well, actually
I was hoping

you and I could do
something together.

Get out!

That's it, Dad.

Get a job, get a hobby,
or get some friends,

because I can't

Can I start you off with...

Will you sing the Krabby
Monday's birthday song

to my special

Happy,

Happy, happy...

CARL:
Uh, Squidward?

Can I talk to you
for a second?

What's our motto here
at Krabby O'Mondays?

"Sincere service
with a smile."

Well, yes...

but with the Krabby
O'Mondays spirit.

Now, Squidward,
you wouldn't want

to have to talk
to Human Resources...

would you?

So, what's
our motto again?

Uh... uh... sincere service...
with a smile.

Now you're getting it.

[ humming happily]

Morning, SpongeBob!

Mr. Krabs!

What are you
doing here?

Retirement ain't all
it's cracked up to be,

so I'm the new busboy.

[ whistling]

Uh, okay, son,

you're starting
to creep me out.

I knew you'd come back,
Mr. Krabs,

I just knew you would!

Okay, boy, back to work.

Ayeaye, sir.

I'm not
your boss anymore.

Just call me Eugene.

Ayeaye... Eugene.

[ giggles]

Ahoy, Squidward!

Ahoy, Eugene!

Would you mind clearing
this table for me?

Sure, Squidward.

You know, I've never
seen you so happy.

They're watching us.

That guy's a real
pain in the hindquarters,
hey, Squiddy?

[ laughing]

Uh, Eugene, I think
you need to look

at page 20 of our employee
handbook again.

Oh, I don't need
Carl's silly rules.

I reallythink you should look.

What's this?

"Help me."

Hey, fellas, what's
going on over here?

Oh, hey, Carl.

I was just reminding Eugene

of article 24, section three

of the employee handbook.

"Cut the chatter
and pick up a platter."

Good job, Squidward.

What have you done
with the real Squidward?

The less you know, Eugene,
the better.

What's going on around here?

Where's SpongeBob?

Where's the love?

SpongeBob!

What happened to
the Krabby Patties?

I tried to tell them,

but they wouldn't
listen to me!

This is obscene!

Carl!

I need to have a word...

Your change is $1.75.

Automated cash register?!

No!

Hey, Carl, what
have you done with
me restaurant?!

Processed Krabby Patties,
computerized registers...

Look around you.

Our customers are quite content

with the contrived
and the mediocre.

[ snoring]

That's because
they don't know

what they're eating.

Excuse me, ma'am,
do you know

what's in that Krabby
Patty you're eating?

No.

[ screams]

See that?

Without all your
smoke and mirrors,

no one would stomach
this garbage.

What'd he say?

Garbage?

[ all screaming]

Eugene, you're in violation
of your contract.

Rules!

Here's a rule for you:

people can't eat stainedglass
barstools!

I'll show you automated.

Mr. Blandy, code red
free thinker!

Mr. Krabs, is there
a problem here?

You better believe it!

I used to kiss the ground
you walked on, Blandy,

but after seeing this,

I wouldn't even spit
in your direction.

Krabby Patties are supposed
to be made by hand

one at a time

not on a conveyer belt!

[ rumbling as siren blares]

Oh, my...

Does this mean I won't get
that raise, sir?

BLANDY:
It's ruined!

We'll have to sell it.

We'll be lucky
if we get a fraction

of what we paid for it.

I'll buy it
for full price.

Sold.

We won't need
your contract anymore.

Nice doing business with you.

Pleasure's
all mine.

Now get out
of me restaurant.

[ laughing]

Well, we did it, boys.

The Krusty Krab is ours again.

You know, in that fit
of maniacal rage

I may have destroyed
the restaurant,

scared away all our customers
and forced us into bankruptcy

because I returned
nearly every penny

I sold this stinkheap for

but I got back the love
of me dear friends.

Really, Mr. Krabs?

No, not really.

Get back to work!

[ register jingles]

SPONGEBOB:
Oh, Squidward!

Another day, another dollar.

More like another nickel.

Good one, Squidward!

[ laughing]

Another day, another nickel.

It's not that funny.

That's funny
because it's true.

[ SpongeBob laughing

Carpool's over.

Nickel.

Here's your food.

It's not that funny!

Okay, Squidward,

And always check
for spare change.

Another day, another... nickel!

Two Krabby Patties.

Thanks, kid.

Another day,
another nickel.

[ laughing]

Oh.

[ all laughing]

Cease your laughing, tormentor!

[ laughing alternates 
with cries of pain]

This could be my chance.

SpongeBob,
you don't look well.

I don't?

No.

You should sit down.

Shh...

You're burning up,
SpongeBob.

I am?

Tell me, SpongeBob,

have your
sides been hurting?

Yeah, a little.

And your temperature
is 175 degrees!

Is that bad?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

unless you've been doing
a lot of... laughing.

I have been laughing
a lot lately.

[ gasps]

SpongeBob,

you've got to be careful.

You're going to burn
out your laughbox.

My laughbox?

Yes, it's the part
of your body

that enables laughter.

If you use it too long
without giving it a break

it burns out
and you can never
laugh again.

Is that what happened
to you, Squidward?

Yes... What? No!

Listen, SpongeBob,
this is serious!

If you burn out
your laughbox,

you'll live
your whole life

without ever
laughing again.

Hey, Patrick, you want
to hear a joke?

Sure, Sandy.

Sure, I'd love
a good laugh.

What has four
wheels and flies?

A garbage truck!

[ both laughing]

[ flat, mechanical 
laughter]

[ laughter dies away]

I don't want to burn out
my laughbox, Squidward.

Well, the most
important thing
is to stop laughing.

Any laugh at all
could be dangerous.

How long do I have
to avoid laughing?

Gosh, SpongeBob,
I'd say

at least
the rest of the day,

but you better go 24 hours
just to be safe.

Thank you so much,
Squidward.

I don't know what
I'd do without you!

A day without laughter
is a small price to pay

to save my laughbox
from destruction.

I must remain vigilant.

Nothing funny over there.

Nothing funny over here.

PATRICK:
Hey, SpongeBob!

How's it going?

Patrickbanana peeldon't!

What did you say...

[ screaming]

Oh, no...

Hey, what the...

Wait a minute, Patrick!

Please stop!

Right foot first...

Wait, Patrick,
I can't laugh.

You can't?

Oh, I know what to do.

That usually knocks him out.

[ panting]

Get a grip on yourself,
SpongeBob.

You're in control.

[ sputtering]

Just back away from
the whoopie cushion, SpongeBob.

[ sputtering]

[ gasps]

They're everywhere!

Everywhere!

Look out for
that pie truck!

[ screaming]

[ tittering]

I've got to get out of here!

[ cushions sputtering]

There's nothing funny up here.

But just to be safe...

[ crowing]

Ah, I made it 24 hours
without laughing.

[ exhales]

That's odd.

[ exhales]

I've lost my laugh.

[ screaming]

I've lost my laugh!

[ screaming]

Hi, SpongeBob.

It's terrible, Patrick

I can't laugh anymore.

What happened?

I went a whole day
without laughing

and now my laugh is gone.

Let me take a look.

Hmm... it's dark
in here.

I'd better light
a match.

[ coughing]

[ screaming]

[ knock at door]

Come in.

[ sniffling]

Mr. Krabs?

What's wrong, boy?

I lost my laugh.

You've come to
the right place, son.

You know, there's one thing
that always makes me laugh.

[ chortling]

Don't it just
tickle you, boy?

Not really.

This calls for
drastic measures.

I don't usually
do this,

but you seem
desperate.

Touch it.

Nothing.

Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

After all, money is the ultimate
source of joy.

Maybe I should ask Sandy.

She's a scientist.

SANDY:
Oh, it's easy if you approach it
scientifically, SpongeBob.

Now, what is laughter?

The thing that used to give
my life meaning and purpose

but now mocks me
with its cruel indifference.

Scientifically,
it's caused by

your epiglottis
constricting your larynx,

causing irregular air intake
and respiratory upset.

Sounds painful.

Science makes everything
sound painful.

Now, here's some
humortheory textbooks,

laugh mechanics
and the quantum
giggle theory.

Thank you, Sandy.

Sure is peaceful around here

since SquarePants
became a sad sack.

I've read all the books,
and still nothing.

I guess I'll never laugh again.

[ moaning]

I really hate to see
the little guy so sad,

but not as much as I hate
to see him happy.

[ SpongeBob wailing]

I think I found the one thing
I hate more than his laugh.

I'm sure
he'll cry himself out soon.

[ sobbing]

What have I done?

Oh, that's it.

This charade has to end!

Hi, Squidward.

SpongeBob, this infernal crying
has to stop!

But Squidward, I...
I broke my laughbox!

[ sobbing]

SpongeBob, there's
no such thing
as a laughbox!

I made
the whole thing up

to get some peace from
your insipid laughter!

You mean my laughbox
isn't broken?

And it was a cruel lie

that sent me
into spiraling depression?

Uh... yeah, well,
it sounds pretty harsh

when you put it
that way, but... yeah.

I could laugh the whole time?

Yeah.

[ annoying laugh returns]

[ joins in raucous laughter]

You really fell for it!

I guess I did.

You even fell
for the old

thermometerin
theboilingoil routine!

[ screeching 
with laughter]

It's not really
that funny, Squidward.

It's hilarious!

See you later,
Squidward.

[ laughing wildly]

Break your laughbox!

What a schlemiel!

Whoohoohoo!

[ gagging]

[ siren wails]

Look, he's
waking up.

Oh... where am I?

You're in
the hospital, silly.

You broke your laughbox.

The doctor said it was
the most tiny, dried out,

underused laughbox
he'd ever laid eyes on.

So they cut it out.

Cut it out?

Yeah! Want to see it?

It's fun
to shake it up

and watch it
bounce around.

Oh, give me!

Oh, I can never laugh again?

Nonsenseyour laugh should be
stronger than ever.

But you cut out
my laughbox.

Yes, but one of your friends
has generously allowed us

to transplant part of theirs
to you.

Nope.

They wouldn't pay me.

You're getting warmer.

SpongeBob?

Hey, you laugh

I made merry mirth

songs for the king

and he just has
to hear them.

Isn't that right,
Squidly?

Absolutely.

and are sent by the king
to rid the lamenting town

of the evil dragon controlled
by the oneeyed wizard.

Father, don't you
get it? It's them.

These strangers have
come to rescue us.

Like in the prophecy.

[ panicked yelling]

How dare you defile my house,
demon?!

[ yells]

[ dragon snarling, 
princess yelling]

Princess Pearl!

I'm coming, Pearl.

Prepare to meet
thy maker,

foul beast!

[ yelling]

[ sniffles]:
Well, II guess
this is it, Patrick.

I guess so.

I'm going to miss you,
SpongeBob.

[ bawling]

I'll miss you, too, buddy.

[ crying]

[ both crying]

[ SpongeBob blathering]

[ yelling]

[ Pearl yells]

PEARL:
Oh, Daddy, help!

Pearl!

[ crying]

Can no one stop this madness?

[ birds chirping, 
magical music plays]

You... you two...

My apologies,

most noble...
[ kisses]

and valued... [ kisses]

warriors... [ kissing]

I guess this is what you
call the royal treatment.

[ grunts]
May Neptune grant you safety

on your perilous journey
to the evil wizard's castle

from which no one
has escaped alive.

We're going
on a perilous journey?

But of course.
You're the chosen ones.

Huh? What's this?

A lost piece
of the prophecy?

Hmm?

Let me guessmore praise
for our heroic stature?

Actually, it says I was supposed
to kick you out of here.

Say no more,
Your Majesty.

Us manly knights
are so manly,

we kick ourselves
out of places.

Come on, Patrick.

Look out, trouble.

Well, so much
for their company.

[ playing offkey]

Eh... on second thought,
you better go with them.

They could use
the entertainment.

Have it your way.

Good luck, strange ones.

SPONGEBOB:
I know we're a prophecy and all,

but I don't think
we can stop the dragon

with our bare hands.

Yeah. We need some gloves.

Perhaps yonder
blacksmith

could provide some
arms for your battle.

[ metallic clanking]

At last! An honest man
of the soil.

Observe
as I effortlessly commingle

with this brutish native.

Greetings, Iron Man!

I am Sir SpongeBob, of Bikini...

[ strained]:
Bottom.

I told you people before.

I'll have the rent
when I have it!

[ gasps]

We just wanted to buy
some armor.

Oh, why didn't you just
say that?

Hmm.

I've got just the thing
for you.

This is awesome.

Hey, SpongeBob, get out here!

Whoa, SpongeBob,

you look incredible.

And now, for the piece
de resistance.

Your sword, brave knight.

Handforged from anodized
dragon's skin.

It is truly a weapon worthy
of a knight of your stature.

A little heavy, isn't it?

[ laughs]

That's going to need
some stitches.

Let me see what else I got.

Unfortunately, all I have
in the way of light weaponry

is this jellyfish net.

[ gasps]

That's perfect!

Whah!

We doth have a long journey
ahead of us.

It's a good thing
I packed us a lunch

of delicious krabby patties.

Ooh.

Thisbe the
legendary prophecy?!

[ laughs evilly]

Oh, that beeth rich.

T'would almost insult me,
were it not so funny.

Planktonimor,
thou art cocky

and overlyconfident
with thyself.

Trusteth in me, Karen.

I doth knowest what I am doing.

Come hither, boy.

Deliver my demands
unto his majesty, King Krabs.

[ laughs]

[ laughter intensifies]

[ choking]

Halt! Who goes there?

[ gasps]
Doth mine eyes betray me?

'Tis the nefarious
Dark Knight.

Oh, Dark Knight,
spare us please

Don't cut off our heads
or boil our knees

Pray, take these two

And let me go free

And I will give to
thee some... cheese.

[ cow moos]

BOTH:
Dark Knight?

I asketh once more, before I
rip thee limb from limb.

Reveal thyself.

I am SpongeBob,
and this is Patrick.

[ laughs nervously]

We've been spent to rescue
Princess Pearl

from Planktonimor.

If thou wisheth to get across,

thou willst have to get
through me!

[ gasps]

Medieval Sandy.

I know how to handle this:
with a little karate.

[ emits battle cry]

Whah! Whah!

[ both yelling]

By the hammer of Odin,

this be a new
fighting style

mine eyes
have not yet seen.

I am bad! Oh, yeah!

Whoo!

Doth thou tryeth to insult me?

Thou whilst drink
from the fountain of shame!

[ emitting 
battle cry]

Do you hear that, Patrick?

I told you she zings
like a squir... Whoa!

[ blows landing][ SpongeBob yelling]

[ laughs]

Good one, medieval Sandy.

But can you handle
my feet of fury?

[ yelling]

Wouldst thou like
a little rubdown?

[ Sandy coughing]

[ gasps]

[ coughing]

[ gasping]

You have bested me,
yellow knight.

Strike quick and true,

noble sponge.

I don't understand a word
you just said.

[ laughs]

Uh, medieval Sandy?

You don't
look so good.

Sandy?

[ warbled]:
Sandy...

Huh? What?

Patrick, it's working.

Do it again.

[ gargling]

[ yelling]

Thou hast spared me,
kind and noble sponge,

and to thee,
I owe a debt of gratitude,

for I will follow you in your
quest to defeat Planktonimor

and learn a trifle
of that karate.

Yeah! Karate!

Whah! Chacha!

Oweth.

Your majesty, your majesty!

A scroll hath arrived
for thee.

"Thou must hand over
thy village... and they throne?!

Or thy daughter shall be dipped
in a cauldron of lava?!"

Pearl!

[ screaming]

That be the shriek
of the fair princess.

Hark, the princess,
she screams from the tower

By the sound of her shrieks,
this is her final hour.

[ thunder rumbles]

Then time be of the essence.

Doth we all remember thy plan?

[ all affirming hesitantly]

No. Uh...
I mean yes!

Yes!

That's what I said.

Yes.

Then let us forge on.

Make way, heathens.

Dark Knight coming through.

Huh?

State thy business,
Dark Knight.

These village idiots
are conspirators

against Master Planktonimor

and I needeth to know
which form of torture

thy master wishes
upon these wretched fools.

Do I have their limbs tied
to horses

and swiftly yanked apartrip!

[ all gasp]

Or pluck each individual
eyelash, one by one,

taking away their every single
last eyelash wish?

No...!

No, no, no!

Very well, Dark Knight.

Entrance be granted.

No, no, no!

No, no, no!

Halt!
Make a wish!

[ laughs]

Wow, goodsome thinking,
Sir SpongeBob,

posing as a frightened wee babe
in ye old diapers

did make it
most believable.

Yeah, you think
we fooled them?

[ Pearl screaming]

Princess Pearl.

I must fulfill
the prophecy

while you untie Patrick
and the royal doofus.

That be royal fool.

Hang on, Pearl.

We're coming to rescue you.

Whew.

Freedom is at hand.

[ panting]

We're acoming.

Almost there.

Oh, dear Neptune.

[ Planktonimor laughing]

Soon, the king's village
will be mine.

Mine!

Mine!

[ screaming]

Unhand her...
fiend!

The prophecy is nigh.

[ panting]

We're here to
rescue you, Pearl.

Whew!

Could I get a
glass of water?

Sparkling or regular?

Psycheeth!

[ gasps]

You truly are
the nastiest wizard

in all of Bikini Bottomshire.

Prepare to be vanquished!

Bring it oneth, knave.

[ yelling]

[ squishing]

Huh? What the... where?!

Oh... [ laughs]

I didn't see you,
you're so tiny.

[ growling]

[ laughs]

That tickles.

Tiny powers!
Tiny powers!

[ yelling]

[ yell becoming distant]

I beeth okay.

[ laughing]

Wow... Huh?

Yes! Yes!

Sicceth them, boy!

Perhaps a soothing
limerick will calm thee.

There once was a dragon
so handsome and smart

He let me go free,
for he had a big heart.

Everyone beeth a critic.

[ Sandy making karate noises]

No, no, no, no!

[ roaring]

Dead end for you, simpletons.

[ laughs]

Wait a second.

[ yelling]

[ chuckles]

Wow, the boys back home
will never believe this.

I'm right here,
and I don't believe it.

Whoa!

No! No!
No! no!

Well, I guess
this is it, Pat.

Yeah.

Hey, can we eat those
krabby patties now?

Sure, buddy.

Yay!

[ sniffs]Hey!

Patrick, look,

he's eating the
krabby patty.

Huh?

No, no, no!

The horror, the horror!

No, Patrick,
it's a good thing.

It is?

Sure it is.

Just listen to him purr.

He loves that
krabby patty.

Forsooth, what beeth
going on here?

Destroy them!

Do it now, or so help me...

Um, I'd be more than happy
to make you some more

of those delicious
krabby patties.

Curses. You win.

[ playing fanfare]

Make way. Thy king's heroes
cometh through.

Hark, ring the bell

'Tis all ended well

The dragon is vanquished,
the princess returned

And only a few

Of us got badly burned.

Order up!

Hmm. I doth wonder if I couldst
sell these... krabby patties.

[ laughs]

[ crowd booing]

Ah, that
horrible noise.

Oh, make it stop!

[ neighing]

Whoa!
Whoa!

WOMAN:
Hey, kid, are you okay?

That was some fall
you had.

Oh. I guess I shouldn't
have agitated that sea horse.

That was some dream,
huh, Patrick?

Patrick?

Try telling that to Squidly.

[ plays warbled note]
Are you ready, kids?

KIDS: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

[ louder]: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish.

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Ready?

[ crowd screaming]

[ crowd gasps]

[ crowd screaming]

[ all scream]

Oh, good, the lunch rush.

Now that my Chumbot has dropped
you into my clutches,

you'll be forced to eat
at the Chum Bucket!

[ all scream]

What?

You kidnapped us
just to sell us your fast food?

Come on, it's a standard
marketing technique.

You little twerp!

Hey!

COMPUTER:
He's right.

Karen!

You think
I'm a twerp?

Well, yes,

but I was referring
to the kidnapping.

Everything I do is
always wrong in your eyes!

Maybe it's because
you arealways wrong.

FineI'm wrong, you're right.

You said it, not me.

Why did I ever install
that nagging software?

Nagging software?
I heard that!

Dust my screen!

MR. KRABS:
Oh, money,

you're always there for me.

[ kissing noisily]

Hello, Eugene.

Mother!

What brings you by today?

I just wanted to see

me favorite son.

How much of my money
do you want?

Well, I did see
the prettiest hat in town today.

Oh, look at the time!

So sorry to have
to rush off.

Bye, bye.

Whew, that was a close one.

Why did I ever buy
that computer wife?

I need a realwoman

not a girl
in a cold, hard shell.

[ Karen complaining]

[ humming]

PLANKTON:
Such beauty.

She's an angel; and no wires!

I've never felt
like this before.

I don't even know her name,
and yet she's stolen my heart.

KAREN:
Plankton!

You've fallen in love
with another woman?

I'm your wife!

You're a W.I.F.E.:

wired integrated female
electroencephalograph.

Oh! You always pull 
thatone out!

"You're not a real wife.

[ emotionally]:
You're just a computer!"

Aah! Why don't you have
an "off" switch?

[ fading]:
Plankton, don't you dare...

And now to woo
that beloved creature.

[ snoring]

[ screaming]

Roses are red.

Violets are blue.

World domination
has nothing on you.

[ screaming]

Hmm, I guess
she's not a poetry fan.

[ all screaming]

[ screaming]

Poetry, love notes
nothing's working.

Maybe something personal.

[Mrs. Krabs shrieking]

Am I really that pretty?

Oh, yeah...

I am smooth.

Just dial the number
and ask her to dinner.

Come on, you can do this.

[ dial tones beeping, 
Plankton grunting]

[ panting]

MRS. KRABS:
Hello?

[ Plankton panting]

I'm hanging up.

Wait!

It's your secret admirer.

Oh, you're that giant robot?

[ laughing]

No.

I program the robot.

Did you enjoy the gift
I sent you?

How did you know I wanted a hat?

Have you been spying on me?

It was... just a lucky guess.

I've admired you from afar
for too long, my angel.

We must meet facetoface.

Well, how about the Krusty Krab
tonight at 8:00?

Sounds wonderful.

I'll be the tall fellow
wearing a red carnation.

Until tonight... my dear.

Ah! Quick, SpongeBob,
swallow me wallet!

Okay.

Oh, sorry, Mommy.

I can't lend you
any money.

SpongeBob accidentally
swallowed me wallet.

Mommy, you got
yourself a hat

without me financial
assistance!

Isn't it nice, Eugene?

It's just the one I wanted.

But, Mommy, you
shouldn't be spending
my inheritance...

I mean, since you told me
you wanted a hat,

I dug one up.

Where did you get
this old thing?

She looks so peaceful.

Yeah, but wasn't
she wearing a hat?

You can take this back
to the trash heap.

Yes, Mommy.

KRABS:
Squidward, make
a return for me!

Thank ye for your concern
about me finances,

but me new boyfriend
bought me this hat.

Boyfriend?

Someone to spend money...

"time" with you?

That's wonderful!

Who is he?

What's his name?

I don't know.

I'm meeting him here tonight.

Wonderful!

I'll stay open late

so ye can have a nice,
romantic dinner.

Run along,
make yourself pretty.

SpongeBob, you're working late!

No overtime!

Ah!

[ clears throat]

I've reservations
for two tonight.

Right this way, sir.

[ shouts]:
Excuse me!

I can't reach my silverware!

Terribly sorry, sir.

Will there be
anything else?

Is my tie on straight?

You look fabulous!

Your gentleman
caller awaits.

Hello, my dear.

I must say you look
ravishing tonight.

Oh my, you're
a tiny thing,
but awfully cute.

Tell me about yourself.

Well, I'm in
the food service business.

I'm a bit of a restaurateur.

I'm the founder
and owner of the Chum Bucket.

Never heard of it.

It's across the street.

Doesn't ring a bell.

It's on the back
of the phone book.

[ shouts]:
Come on, I paid a lot of money
for that ad!

Never mind, never mind.

I'd like to hear about you.

Well...

Plankton!

Krabs!

Eugene!

Mommy?

"Mommy"?

SpongeBob!

SpongeBob!

This delectable creature
is yourmother?

This nogood conniving
chiseler is your date?

And this handsome sponge
is your waiter.

SpongeBob!

I don't know what sort of
skullduggery you're up to,

and I'm not waiting
to find out.

Eugene, you put
me boyfriend down
this instant.

Boyfriend?

But, Mommy...

You heard the lady.

Let me go.

That's more like it.

Come, Plankton.

I'm sorry me son
had to spoil our
romantic evening.

Mommy?

You!

Eugene.

I came to warn you,
Plankton.

Stay away from me mother!

I know what you're
really up to!

I'm serious, Eugene.

I've changed my ways.

And all it took was
the love of a beautiful woman.

All you love is
thieving and conniving.

Now, stop trying
to get the formula
out of me mother.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about
the Krabby Patty formula!

Your mother knows
the Krabby Patty formula?

Don't play stupid with me.

Of course she does.

It's an old
Krabs family recipe.

And you're not family.

I'm telling you
for the last time:

stay away from me mother.

Not family, eh?

Well, I can fix that.

Eugene!

Mommy!

What did I tell ye about
interfering in me life?

Mommy, can't you see?

He's trying to seduce the
Krabby Patty formula from you.

For your information, Eugene,

he hasn't asked me once
about the formula.

I doubt that he even knows
that I know it.

Uh, yeah...
funny thing about that.

I forbid ye to interfere
in me private business.

Go to your office.

Now!

Yes, Mommy.

PLANKTON:
Somebody call heaven;

I think an angel's gone missing.

Oh, Sheldon.

Oh, Mrs. Krabs.

Oh, brother.

PLANKTON:
Attention, everyone.

I'd like to make
an announcement.

Mrs. Krabs, in full view
of this restaurant,

I ask you for your hand
in holy matrimony.

CROWD:
Aw!

Would you marry me?

[ crowd gasps]

Aah, that's it!

No more hiding in my room
like a scared little kid.

It's time to act like a man.

[ bellowing like Tarzan]

Gasp!

Please don't marry him,
Mommy.

Don't marry
this bad, bad man.

I don't want you to!

Too late, Krabsy!

We're going
to be married.

And you're going to be
my new son.

[ laughing maniacally]

Huh?

What's this, honey bunch?

I am flattered
by your offer.

Really I am.

But I'm just not ready
for that kind of commitment.

Hah!

[ laughing]

What is this?

There's somebody else,
isn't there?

[ Chumbot stomping 
thunderously]

I... I...

This is very uncomfortable.

I'll just wait in the car.

I don't believe this!

You led me on!

Now, now, Plankton,
it's not what ye think.

I don't want to hear
your lies!

You owe me for leading
me on like this!

Give me the Krabby Patty
formula, and we'll call it even.

The formula?!

Is that what this whole
thing was about?

No, no, not really.

I mean, not at first.

I mean, uh...

Honey bunch?

Uhoh.

[ fist punches]

Oh, well, 'tis better
to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all!

Working.

So you've decided to come
crawling back to me, huh?

[ angrily]:
What did you say?

Nothing, dear.

[ screams]

Yeah, that's what
I thought you said,
honey bunch.

[ moans]

Huh? Eh?

NARRATOR:
It's Mermaidman!

Savior of the deep!

And his young, fit servant,
Barnacleboy!

Mermaidman and
Barnacleboy...

unite!

KelpThing, this is a posted
noparking zone.

But I must do what I do.

[ snickering]

Huh?

Evil can't park here

between the hours
of 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.!

[ cheering]

Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy
Fan Club members

unite!

ALL:
Unite!

And now, the second
order of business,

Drippy Brothers Studios
is currently in production

on the Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy movie!

ALL:
Ooh...

Oh, boy, Patrick,

I can hardly wait to see
our favorite heroes

on the big screen!

[ guffaws]

Third order of business,
the special surprise guest.

[ all gasp]

The stars of the Mermaidman
movie are here tonight!

[ cheering]

Directly from the set,
here they are!

Hello, little heroes.

Huh?

You're not Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy.

You're fakes.

Well, of course
we arewe're actors.

Actors?

How can you make
a Mermaidman movie

without the real
Mermaidman and Barnacleboy?

Listen, kid, this is
an action movie!

Your hasbeen heroes
are too oldfor action.

Mermaidman
is timeless.

Yeah!

I think I speak
for everyone here

when I say we won't stand

for these two
phony baloneys

ruining the good name
of our heroes.

No rightminded Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy society member

would ever pay to see this...
this celluloid hoax.

I say we boycott this movie!

Now who's with me?!

Traitors!

Wait till we tell
Mermaidman about this!

ANNOUNCER:
B47.

Bonko!

It's "Bingo"!

Get your hands
off me, woman!

A29.

Too old for
an action movie...

huh.

What is it
this time, kid?

Are you aware that Drippy
Brothers Studios is making

the Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy movie?

They can't be making
a movie about us!

But they are.

And they're using...

actors.

[ both gasp]

They have shunned
our heroes.

And they weren't nice
to them either.

[ wailing]

Now our dreams of
being bigscreen heroes

will never come true!

Well, that makes it
even worse!

You bet it does, kid.

And the worst part is

I can't remember why
I started crying.

[ sobbing]

Why don't we just make
our own movie?

Patrick, once again you have
exposed your brilliance!

We'll make a real Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy movie!

Right here at Shady Shoals.

You will?

Yes!

And in doing so, we will
right the wrong done to you

by the evil Drippy Brothers
Studios and...

their actors.

Vindication is ours!

Vindi...

How did I
get up here?

SPONGEBOB:
Okay, Patrick,

what do we need
to start a movie?

Popcorn?

No, Patrick, to start
making a movie.

Oh, oh, oh...

Let's start with...
the title.

Yeah, yeah.

Ooh! I got one!

"Adventures in
the Underground City."

Great, Pat!

What happens?

Well, there's a city...

City...

and it's underground...

Underground...

and they have an adventure!

Adventure...

The end.

End.

That's great, Pat!

Hmm, seems kinda short.

I have an idea!

Let's make it longer.

Longer, yes!

Okay, let's have
Mermaidman

get his face shrunk
by KelpThing's face minimizer.

Yeah, and then he, um...
he drinks... cheese coffee!

[ laughing]

Good one, Pat.

[ both laughing]

What are
ye lads doing?

We're making
a movie.

Great!

I got cinema's newest
star right here.

[ giggles]

What do you say, lad?

Sure, Mr. Krabs,
Pearl can be in our movie.

I wasn't talking about Pearl.

I was talking about
the Krabby Patty.

You can be
in it, too, Pearl.

I'm going to be a movie star!

SPONGEBOB:
Let's meet

the highly skilled
professionals

who will help us
fulfill your dream

of being on
the big screen.

Sandy will handle
the stunts and explosives.

Howdy!

Pearl is
the leading lady.

Mr. Krabs will
cater the affair.

Patrick will
run the camera.

Hey...

This is Squidward.

He's in charge of
the makeup department.

Uh, no, thanks.

Who wants to be
the "makeup department"?

Not makeup department,
you're the makeup artist.

Artist?

Makeup artist.

In that case, let's make those
old crabapples sizzle.

Hmm...

Time for the arteest
to go to work.

[ banging and yelling]

[ stapling and screaming]

Voilà!

SPONGEBOB:
Okay, places, everybody!

Squidward, are
our heroes ready?

As they'll ever be.

[ gasps]

They're beautiful!

They look just like
they did 30 years ago.

[ slurping]

Okay, action!

I love my new job!

Good job, Sandy!

PLANKTON:
Psst...

I, Man Ray,

have returned
from the murky depths

to seek my revenge
and banish your souls

to the nether regions!

Their defenses
are strong.

But they're no match
for my ManRay ray!

What are you doing?

SpongeBob, this role
was made for me.

That villain isn't
even in this movie.

But let me see if we
have something

that fits your
qualifications.

Oh, here's something.

You can be the boom operator!

I thought Sandy
was the boom operator!

Did somebody
say "boom"?

All right, SpongeBob.

But you're squandering
my talents!

Okay, Patrick,
start the movie!

ASSISTANT:
Take one.

We have to get back those
swollen Krabby Patties.

Cut!

No, Mermaidman,

it's "stolen Krabby Patties."

Take Two.

We have to get back

to those stolen
maggie daddies.

Cut!

No, Mermaidman,
it's "stolen Krabby Patties"!

Take 5,003.

We have to get back
those stolen Krabby Patties!

And if we don't stop
that diabolical scoundrel...

[ mumbling]

Give it back!

I knew this was a bad idea.

Cut!

Plankton, next time, could you
keep the boom out of the shot?

Other than that,
you're doing a super job.

This is humiliating.

I'm not good
at this boom thing.

Did somebody say "boom"?

Oh, Daddy...

you said I was going
to be a star!

You are, Pearl.

Mermaidman wouldn't get
anywhere without you.

Go out there
and break a leg!

Yeah!

Okay, action!

To the boatmobile!

Cue sound effects!

[ imitating engine]

Listen to that engine purr.

[ straining]

Almost there!

Good morning,
SpongeBob.

SPONGEBOB:
Everything's ruined!

Well, at least we got
the footage!

Yeah, I got the footage!

Patrick, what is that?

Oh, it's a camera.

No, Patrick, this.

Oh, that's a lens cap.

Did you just put that on?!

No, I didn't want to lose it,

so I put it there right
before we started filming.

[ blathering]

[ gasping]

The movie's ruined!

We can't make a movie!

Hey, little hero,

this reminds me
of Episode 912.

We were surrounded.

The KelpThing was to our right

and there was broccoli
on the side.

But if there's one
thing I remember,

it's how to forget.

Patrick, this is good.
Roll the film.

MERMAIDMAN:
The rain in Spain

stays mainly on the...

Space! The final countdown!

Stick to the... stick to the...

Loo, my darling!

Lou!

Now get out there
and finish this movie, kid.

[  sobbing]

Mr. Krabs, why
are you weeping?

I closed early for your movie.

Where are the paying customers?!

You promised a full house!

And here comes
the filling!

The Mermaidman and
Barnacleboy Fan Club.

I knew you'd come see

the real Mermaidman
and Barnacleboy movie.

Actually, the real movie
was sold out.

I'll take
200 tickets, please.

Now, this is what I call
a happy ending.

[ both cheering]

Well, our big moment,
us up on the big screen.

[ snoring]

SPONGEBOB:
Fort Lox,

home to over
five billion Krabby Patties.

What evil mastermind would dare
infiltrate this fortified fort

and make off with its treasure?

It is I... KelpThing!

Do what I do!

MERMAIDMAN:
Stop!

You can't do that...

Forbidden!

Watch me!

Prepare to feel my wrath,

you foul villain.

[ making karate yell]

You may have won
the Krabby Patties,

but the battle rages on.

[ round bell ringing]

Mermaidman... nacleboy...

unite!

[ both cheering]

Well, kid,
you showed the world

that even though our steps
may have been slowed,

we still have
a little action left

in these heroic old bones.

[ snapping]

Well, at least
some of them.

[ laughing]
Are you ready, kids?

KIDS: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

I can't hear you.

[ louder]: 
Aye, aye, Captain!

Oh...

Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea?

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he.

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

If nautical nonsense be
something you wish...

SpongeBob SquarePants!♪

Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish.

laughing]

Whoa!

[ both laughing]

[ laughing heartily]

You're it.

[ both laughing]

You're it.

Wait, Pat
you're it!

[ screams]

The sign!

[ laughter turns to fear]

[ yells]

[ thud]

Patrick!

Let me help you
out of there, buddy.

Is the rest of you down there?

The rest of me is up here.

Ooh, you had me
worried there, buddy.

[ laughs]

Here's your head.

[ laughs obnoxiously]

I find all this laughter
to be highly illogical.

Well, let's stop laughing
and let's start fishing.

Go ahead,
you get first crack.

Look at themthese graceful
stoic creatures of the deep.

Huh? Those are
some big words, Pat.

I've never heard you
use them before.

Nonsense, my vocabulary
is infinitely expanding.

Well, let's expand
our jellyfish nets.

Come on, Patrick.

Look, buddy,
I captured one.

Yes, I captured one
as well

without disturbing
its delicate ecosystem.

It is wrong
to harness nature

in such
a barbaric manner.

Okay.

What do you
want to do?

Let us go off and admire

the beauty and
fragility of nature.

Pretty.

Yes, quite.

Fragile.

Indeed.

Come on, Patrick,
let's do something fun.

Oh, you want to run
some statistics

or observe phenomenon

and render hypothesis
of said phenomenon?

I was thinking
more like jumping rope

or onelegged races,
or playing duckduck
hermit crab.

Doesn't feel like fun.

How about some jokes.

[ sighs]

What's the difference
between a guitar
and a jellyfish?

You can't strum a jellyfish.

Yes!

[ laughs obnoxiously]

[ strums beautiful chord]

Oh, my,
look at the time.

I really must be going.

What's wrong with Patrick?

I sure hope he gets better soon.

Are you better, Pat?

Uh, what are you doing?

Just studying
this amazing subspecies.

I'll show you subspecies.

Want to visit
Squidward?

Since I am finished
with my work,

I'll humor you
in your trivial pursuits.

[ playing offkey melody]

I'd recognize that
piece anywhere:

Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67,
"Symphony in Blue."

Patrick?

It's a beautiful piece.

Execution needs
some work.

May I suggest that
on the seventh bar

of the adagio andante
that you add a little fortissimo

on the arpeggiated bflat scale?

Wow, I never thought
to do it like that.

Well, that is
because you rarely think.

How do you know
all that?

A creative outlet provides
a spiritual release

and helps facilitate
a healthy mental balance.

[ inhales deeply]

Does that include [ belching]
belch talking?

Mr. SquarePants,
I find your humor vulgar.

I had no idea you
were so knowledgeable,
Patrick.

Do you think
you could be
my musical mentor?

Uh, guys?

Let's take it
from the top.

[ squeaky notes]

Not so excellent,
Squidward.

Let me demonstrate
the proper technique.

On second thought,
practice makes perfect.

Let's begin.

[ playing nose]

Uh, thank you, my good chap.

Unfortunately this is
a solo piece for clarinet only.

And one, two, three, four.

[ Squidward playing offkey]

PATRICK:
Stop! Enough!

Find yourself a new mentor!

Now that you're free,

let's get some grub.

No, SpongeBob,
I'm afraid not.

Well, I have a brand new bottle
of super bubbly bubble soap.

No, thanks again.

Maybe later
we can play pirates.

Robert, my dear, it's no use.

We've just grown apart.

What?
What do you mean?

I know we've had fun
in the past,

but we're just not
compatible anymore.

It's time we went
our separate ways.

Such is life.

But Patrick,
you're my best friend.

I know it's hard,
but brace up, chap.

[ sniffling]:
Yeah.

Maybe our paths
will cross again some day.

Think fondly of me,
Mr. SquarePants.

Goodbye... Mr. Best Friend.

[ sobbing]

[ doorbell rings]

Sandy, you there?

I need some professional help.

[ Sandy and Patrick laughing]

Patrick?

Well, Pat, the new you
gets an "A" plus.

Why, thank you, Sandra.

I find your
intellect rather
stimulating as well.

SANDY:
Oh, really? Thanks.

Patrick, what do you think
about this problem?

You simply change the literal
term to a coefficient

and the minuend will achieve
the desired quotient.

Even the simplest of mammals
could figure it out

with a little thought.

What do you mean
by that, Patrick?

I'm merely suggesting

you lack the ability
to solve remedial equations.

Are you suggesting
I'm dumb?

I'd use a more sophisticated
word like "impaired."

I think
you'd better leave.

I was only
trying to help.

I don't need your kind
of help, Mr. KnowItAll.

I liked you better
when you were a barnaclehead!

[ sniffling]:
I never thought I'd lose
my best friend.

How can I compete with geniuses?

[ crying]

Surrounded by knowledge
and no one to share it with,

no one I can call friend.

Who's that old chap
I used to run with?

SpongeBob.

At least Patrick's my friend
in my memories.

Ah, the glory days.

Why have we grown apart?

I must apply all that I know
to solve this problem.

What could it be?

What's different?

[ screaming]:
What?!

I'd do anything to have my old
buddy back by my side again.

[ banging on door]

SPONGEBOB [ sadly]:
Coming.

Patrick
you're kidnapping me?

Yes, I am.

Yay!

What should we do?

We are going to
have fun,

whatever
the cost may be.

Let's do this.

Yes, let's have some fun.

Oh, yeah!

Oh, absolutely!

Are you quite sure I found
this activity to be fun?

Yeah.

[ screaming]

That was fun, huh, Patrick?

[ mumbling]

[ sighs]

When did the fun
go away, SpongeBob?

It went away when you
jumped off that cliff

and knocked your head
clean off.

That's it.
That's what?

What are you doing?

I'm going to duplicate
my actions from that day

to ascertain the origin
of my cha...an...nge!

[ distant thud]

SPONGEBOB:
Patrick!

Hold on, buddy.

There you go.

Don't worry, Patrick.

I found your head last time,
I'll find it again.

Not back there,
not under here.

What if I can't find it?

Oh, poor headless Patrick.

Patrick,
your head is back.

But... uh...
do you feel different?

Quite unchanged, actually.

I guess we'll never
have fun together again.

You said you found my dislodged
cranial cap last time.

Yes?

Where exactly
did you find it?

Um... it was right here.

Hmm... impossible.

If I landed here, the trajectory
of my dismembered skull

would cause it to come to rest
not there...

but here,
exactly five meters due north.

But if that's your head,
then what did I pick up over...?

Brain coral.

No wonder you got
so smart, buddy.

Here you go, Patrick,
your old head.

Are you sure you
want to give up being
smart and phosisticated

to be my friend again?

Knowledge can never
replace friendship.

I prefer to be an idiot.

Not just
an idiot, Patrick.

You're also my pal.

Patrick?

Say something, Patrick.

[ belching]:
Hi, SpongeBob.

Patrick, you're back.

Patrick, you're back.

[ both laughing goofily]

[ weird jellyfish war cry]

[ laughing goofily]

[ playing jazzy tune]

[ screaming]

Squidward, we love you!

We love you Squidward,
you're my favorite.

[ Squidward laughing]

[ alarm rings]

All right, all right.

Time for another
hideous day at work.

Uh, just hang in there,
gorgeous.

[ plays note on clarinet]

Your star will shine at
the clarinet recital tomorrow.

[ chuckles]

Time for another glorious day
at work.

Good morning, Squidward.

And isn't it a lovely morning?

Why are you playing
the clarinet?

I'm practicing
for my clarinet recital.

Soon all of Bikini Bottom

will recognize the talent
that is Squidward Tentacles.

Goodbye, SpongeBoob.

See you at the Krusty Krab,
Squidward.

Hey Sandywhat's this?

Well, this here's
my new matter transporter.

It can move things
from one place to another

in the blink of an eye.

Ooh, that sounds fancy.

Let me show you
how it works.

Whoa!

Where'd it go?

Just where you think
it would be.

[ gasps]:
Oh!

Uhoh,
I'm late for work.

Think your machine could
zap me over to the Krusty Krab?

Always did want
to try a critter.

Sure, why not?

Get in there,
SpongeBob.

Woohoo!

Hold on tight.

SPONGEBOB:
Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...

[ garbled]

Well, here we go again.

Hey, Thkwidward.

[ laughs]

What's going on
with this thing?

[ screaming]

What in tarnation?
[ gasps]

Hi, Sandy!

I'm not sure
what it is,

but something seems
different about me.

Yeahme, too.

Hey, what're you doing
with my hand?

What... what am I doing
with your hand?

[ Squidward screams]

What is this?

We're all mixed up
together.

[ Squidward straining]

This is horrible.

I have my clarinet
recital tomorrow.

Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward.

Now we can be best buddies and
do everything together forever.

[ Squidward screams]

Sandy,
was this your doing?

You've got to
get us separated.

Well, I wish I knew how.

Well, you have to
do something.

I can't stay
stuck to him.

Hmm, I wonder what would happen

if I tried zapping you back
in the transporter?

Uh, yeah, good idea
let's do it.

Well, here goes nothing.

TEACHER:
All right, children,
today is Timmy's birthday.

You know what that means
ready, Timmy?

[ strange moaning]

[ teacher and Timmy screaming]

Congratulations,
Mrs. Smith.

You gave birth
to a healthy baby boy.

May I see my baby?

Of course.

[ screams]

I've been in love
with you

ever since I first
laid my eye on you.

Hey, baby,
what's your name?

It's no use, Sandy.

We're still
the same.

Well, that's a darn shame.

You know what?

I was working on the blueprints
for a new invention,

but it's still
in the embryonic stage.

Try anything!

I cannot go to my clarinet
recital like this.

I'll continue working on it.

In the meantime,
you boys keep your heads up.

Together forever.

Misery.

SpongeBob, hasn't anybody
taught you how to ride a bike?

Don't worry, I'll drive.

Ow! Ow!

SpongeBob!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

I got to lay off the hot sauce.

[ crashing]

What in blazes
is going on in here?

Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.

What are you two doing
laying around?

Get to work!

If you say so.

Egad! What happened to you?

Uh, I don't want to know.

Just go do your jobs.

Aye, aye,
cap'n!

Do you have to be such
an accommodating buffoon?

Squidward, everybody
knows I'm a sponge.

I look nothing like a balloon.

I don't have time for this.

I got to man
the cash register.

[ straining

Whew!

Can I help you?

Two Krabby Patties,
please.

SQUIDWARD:
SpongeBob, I need two
Krabby Patties.

Two Krabby Patties
coming right up.

I can't reach the bun.

SpongeBob, what's the hold up?

Ssorry, Mr. Krabs,
I'm on it.

Time is money, boy.

Time is money, right.

[ struggling]

Hello, bun, at last we meet.

[ screams]

[ horrific scream]

And now for...

[ both screaming]

All right, that's it.

I can't afford you
jeopardizing my business.

You two are more trouble
than you're worth.

And don't come back until you
get this problem sorted out.

SPONGEBOB:
Look on the bright side,
Squidward.

At least we still have
each other.

That's how we got in this
predicament in the first place.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like a moment of peace.

[ starts playing clarinet]

Whoa!
Rock on, freaky bro.

SQUIDWARD:
Sandy! Sandy!

Please tell me you've figured
out a way to separate us.

Say hello to the
molecular separator ray.

Hello, molecular separator ray.

Well, let's get on with it.

My clarinet recital
is tomorrow night.

Uh, well, I'm not quite
done with it yet.

What?

I'm still
putting it together.

At best
I'll have it ready,

uh... day after tomorrow maybe?

What?
Day after tomorrow?

No, no, no, no!

I have a performance
tomorrow.

I can't be stuck
to that yellow freak.

Sandy, please
you got to do it
before the show.

Well, uh,
I suppose...

I'll have it ready
before you go on.

[ straining]

SQUIDWARD:
Of course.

Oh, my.

Where are you Sandy?

Sandy?

I can't do it,
I can't go out there.

Squidward...
this is your moment,

the story you will tell

when you look back
as a... superstar.

Superstar?

Now go out there
and give them

the best darned show
they've ever seen.

You're right
the show must go on.

ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlefish,

Bikini Bottom's
community rec center

is proud to present
Squidward Tentacles.

[ applause]

[ crowd oohs]

[ playing soulful tune]

Honey, I'm scared.

[ continues playing]

[ cloth tears]

[ crowd gasps]

Uh... hi.

Whoa!

[ laughs]

Rock on, freaky bro.

Yeah! Whoo!

[ crowd commenting]

[ cheering and whistling]

Wow,
they really liked it.

MR. KRABS:
There you go, Squiddy.

[ crowd cheering]

They... they...
they're cheering.

Superstardomthis must
be what it feels like.

This is what it looks like,

what it... sounds like,

and... [ inhales deeply]
what it smells like.

Wow, simply intoxicating.

Whoowee!
Well, there you boys are.

Looks like I'm just in time.

Sandy?

One blast of this
molecular separator ray

and you'll be
separated for good.

No, no wait
Sandy, don't.

[ crowd gasps]

[ disappointed grumbling]

[ starts playing clarinet]

I think I'm going to be sick.

Ah, I'm out of here.

Huh?
No, wait, wait!

Aw, come on.

Oh, my one moment
of fame gone.

There's got to be some way
to reverse this.

No, Squidward,
that's a very sensitive device.

Squidward,
I wouldn't...

So, what seems to be
the problem, Mr. Tentacles?

It all started when I was born.

SpongeBob! Look!

SPONGEBOB:
Wow!

What happened to
the Krusty Krab?

MR. KRABS:
Good morning!

The Krusty Towers
is now open for business.

Why did you build a hotel,
Mr. Krabs?

I'm glad
you asked, son.

Remember when I went to
that fast food convention

and stayed in 
that fancy hotel?

I had a beautiful room.

The employees were so friendly.

They catered to me every whim,

no matter how demeaning it was,

because they lived by a code.

And that code was engraved 
in fine gold

above the grand fireplace.

Everything was perfect.

Until I got the bill!

They charged me for everything.

$25.00 for a hamburger.

[ horn toots]

If they could charge
that much for
a lousy burger,

imagine how much
I could charge for
a lousy Krabby Patty.

And thus,

the Krusty Towers
was born.

Why would anyone stay at a hotel
in Bikini Bottom?

It's in the middle
of scenic nowhere.

There's nothing to do
but get stung by jellyfish.

[ groaning]

See?Eww.

Come inside.

Isn't it beautiful?

Where are all the new
hotel employees?

Me first hotel guest.

Watch me reel him in.

Welcome to
the Krusty Towers,

where our motto is,

"We shall never deny a guest

even the most ridiculous
request."

Oh, that's great.

I'd like a double Krabby Patty

with no onions
and extra pickles.

If you want
a Krabby Patty,

you have to rent a room,
and order room service.

Ooh, I've only got
an hour for lunch.

Boy, you reeled
that one in like a pro.

Okay, Squidward,

you run
the front desk.

I'd like
a Krabby Patty, please.

This is a hotel now.

If you want
a Krabby Patty,

you'll have to get
a room, and order
room service.

Okay.
One Krabby Patty and one room.

With cheese.

Oh, and can I get cheese
on the Krabby Patty, too?

Patrick,

you only live
400 yards away.

Why do you want
to check into a hotel?

Sometimes I just need to get
away from it all.

Wow, this hotel
has everything.

Give me that.

Now sign
the register.

I didn't know
there would be a test.

I didn't study!

Patrick, all you have
to do is write your name.

Oh, okay.

Do you mind?

Don't look.

Um...

Done.

Close enough.

Here's your
room key.

I'll need some help
with my bags.

How can you
have bags?

You just found out
this is a hotel.

This is a hotel?

Doh!
SpongeBob?

Yes, Squidward.

Take Patrick and his bags
to his room.

What about my Krabby Patty?

And bring him a Krabby Patty.

Squidward, you can take
Patrick's bags up to his room.

SpongeBob, you go make
the Krabby Patty.

Oh, Mr. Krabs.

What's the matter?

Afraid of a little
manual labor?

"I'm Squidward, and I have
to work for a living."

Boohoohoo.

Fine.

Let's go,
Patrick.

[ groaning]

This elevator is
for guests only.

Take the employee
elevator.

[ squeaking]

[ bell rings]

[ angry muttering]

[ bell rings]

What's in
these bags? Rocks?

Hey, these are rocks!

Why is your suitcase
full of rocks?

I don't tell you
how to live your life!

Well, here's your room.

Wow.

Enjoy your stay.

Squidward, wait.

Keep up the good work,

and there will be more
where that came from.

Your Krabby Patty, sir.

Hey, Squidward,
cool rock.

Hold on a second,
SpongeBob.

Here you are,
my good man.

Thank you, Patrick.

There's plenty more where that
came from, my good friend.

[ grumbling]

Squidward!What now?

I don't like crusts
on my sandwich.

It's a bun.

It's all crust.

How am I supposed to cut
the crust off a bun?

Peel it.

Happy?Yay!

SPONGEBOB:
Room service.

Here's the 50 Krabby Patties
you ordered.

Could you do
one more thing for me?

Why don't you ask
SpongeBob?

Good idea,
Squidward.

How may I serve you, sir?

I need you to eat these
Krabby Patties with me.

Oh, yes, sir.

[ bell rings]

Uhhuh.Hold on.

Squidward! Patrick
needs your help.

What?!
Why didn't he ask me

before I walked all the way
downstairs?

He said he didn't
want to bother you.

But he got over it.

Hooray!

Thanks, Squidward.

[ toilet flushes]

Mr. Krabs,
this is ridiculous.

Patrick's being completely
unreasonable.

He can be as unreasonable
as he wants.

The plaque, Squidward!
The plaque!

But Mr. Krabs...

Deny no guest!

[ phone rings]

Well, hello, Patrick.

You need Squidward
to come up right away?

He'll be
right there.

A bubble bath?

Why would I give you
a bubble bath?

Well, because Mr. Krabs
said you would.

Be sure to make my back
extra shiny clean.

That's it!

I've had enough!

Squidward, wait!

The toilet's backed up again!

Hey, hey, you can't
take that elevator.

You're an employee.

Not anymore.

I quit.

Quit?

You can't quit.

Welcome to
the Krusty Towers.

Squidward?!

One room, please,
on the top floor.

What do you think
you're doing?

I need a vacation.

I'm overworked.

And what better place to relax
than Krusty Towers,

where we shall never deny
a guest

even the most ridiculous
request.

I don't have to rent you a room.

I got cash.

Doh...
Here's your room key.

SpongeBob, carry my things
to my room.

Aye, aye, guest sir.

[ crashes]

And you can carry me
to my room.

And why in tarnation
would I do that?

You've got four legs
that aren't broken.

The plaque.

Too bad we couldn't take
the elevator,

but it is for guests only,
and you are an employee.

Your room, sir.

And I'd like to order
room service.

I'd like a Krabby Patty
with cheese, toenail clippings

and nose hairs.

[ squeals]

You've got to be kidding me!

And I want it here
in five seconds.

Yes, sir.

Here you are, sir.

Well, you got
your stinky sandwich.

Now eat it.

Oh, I'm not going
to eat this.

You are.

What?!

You're out of your mind if you
think I'm going to eat that.

Psst, that's not really
a Krabby Patty

with cheese, toenails
and nose hair.

[ chuckles]:
Now I get you, boy.

All right, Squidward.

[ laughter]

SpongeBob!Sorry, Mr. Krabs.

We were all out
of cheese.

Hooray!

[ phone ringing]

What is it,
Squidward?

Send up a dozen cookies
just like mother used to make.

Here's your homemade cookies.

These don't taste anything
like mom used to make.

Well, how did your mother
make 'em?

How should I know?

Ask my mother.

[ doorbell rings]

Hello.

[ gasps]

SpongeBob!

No good, Mr. Krabs.

Allow me, boys.

Great.

Now that me laundry
is in the trunk...

There's room for you
to sit up front.

Let's go bake some cookies,
boys.

Hooray!

Well?

I'm impressed.

These are just like mother
used to make.

I just wish mom
was a better cook.

So you're all taken care of.

Just one teensy, tiny problem.

This room is hideous.

Redesign it.

Neptune the 14th would be nice.

What?

"We shall never deny
a guest

even the most
ridiculous request."

[ screaming]

Perfect!

This room is exactly
the same as when we started!

Nothing like getting
back to the basics.

Let's get out of here,
SpongeBob.

Oh, before you leave,

I want to go swimming.

The pool is out back.

[ laughing]:
Are you crazy?

I'm not going outside to swim.

Come on in.

The water's fine.

Anything else stupid

and unreasonable
that you want?

Nope, that's it.

You don't need me to chew
your food for you,

or make you a back scratcher
out of my own spine?

Or maybe extinguish the sun

so the light
don't get in your eyes?

No, I'm good.

Me, too.

Wow!

An indoor pool.

This place is fancy!

Cannonball!

[ laughing]

[ loud crash]

MR. KRABS: 
Oh!

That hotel was a bad idea
from the start.

That was a hotel?

Your bill, sir.

$15,000?

You're not going to have
a heart attack, are you?

Not at these prices.

Forget hotels.

This hospital racket
is where the money is.

This is a hospital?

Pack your bags, boys.

You're going
to medical school.

Hooray!Hooray!

Oh, boy.

Good morning, Mrs. Puff. 
I'm Mr. Fitz.

I represent the Voting Teachers
Accreditation Bureau.

As you know, your teaching
certificate is up for renewal.

However,
we've noticed there have been

an unusually large amount
of failings from this classroom.

That's impossible.

In all my years of teaching,

only one student
has failed my class.

Yes, but he's failed
1,258,056 times.

SPONGEBOB:
Aiaiaiaiaiai!

You don't understand.

SpongeBob is... unteachable.

We cannotblame the students for
the incompetence of the teacher.

SPONGEBOB:
Honk, honk!
Beepbeep!

I'm ready to drive!

[ horn honks]

Are you ready for
my driving test
today, Mrs. Puff?

Okay, Mrs. Puff,
if SpongeBob fails this test,

you will be replaced.

Okay, SpongeBob,
let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz

everything I've taught you
in boating school.

[ chuckles]:
Now,

what's the first thing we do
before we start boating?

Oh! Seatbeltarooni.
One second.

[ grunting]

Then what do you do?

Start the engine?Yes.

[ engine starts]

What do I do now?Drive the boat.

Did I pass this
time, Mrs. Puff?

No, SpongeBob.

You failed.

I failed?

It is not you that's
failed, SpongeBob.

It's Mrs. Puff
that's failed you.

You are relieved
of your teaching duties.

I won't be teaching
SpongeBob anymore?

[ laughing]

[ laughing loudly]

No more... SpongeBob?

I thought this day
would never come.

[ continues laughing]

Whoohoo!

Goodbye, SpongeBob!

Have a nice life.

Free at last!

Free at last!

SPONGEBOB:
I got Mrs. Puff fired.

[ booming footsteps]

Hello, worthless students.

I'm your new instructor.

No one's ever failed my class

that's lived through it.

I can assure you,
these next four weeks

will be the worst years
of your miserable lives.

Your spines will break.

Your teeth will ache.

Your eyes will be bloodshot.

[ students whimpering]

You will drive
out of this school in style,

or you will be carted out

in your granny's
handbasket.

Everyone will follow
the rules of the class.

First rule: no talking.

Does that mean...

Second rule:
no eating in my class.

Would anyone care for a bonbon?

Uh, I'll eat one.

[ students gasp]

Pick your favorite.

How's it taste?

It's a delightful
taste sensation.

No eating in my classroom!

Now, if anyone else
is man enough

to stay in this class...

Looks like you're
the man... Sponge.

I am?

Do you want to learn
how to drive or what?Yes, sir!

I'm ready to drive!

What do you think
you're doing?

Ready for my test, sir.You're not ready

to drive yetuntil
you learn thatfirst.

This is the most grueling
driving course ever devised.

You will learn every turn,
bump and crack on it.

You'll start out
crawling it.

Crawl?

Hup two, hup two,
hup two, hup two!

Left turn!

Crack! Bump! Nickel!

Hey, a nickel!

Keep your eyes on the road,
cadet![ gasps]

SPONGEBOB:
Pebble!

Whoawhoawhoawhoa
whoawhoawhoa!

Ow...!

Wow...!

[ screaming]

Wow...!

[ screaming]

Wow...!

Aah...!

[ sighs]:
Whew!

I'm ashamed
of you, cadet.

Tripped up by a wee pebble.

What are you supposed to
be learning in my class?

How to drive, sir?

Affirmative.
But before you learn to drive,

you must learn
to crawl.

And then you
learn to walk,

and then you
learn to run.

But before you learn to walk,
you must learn to crawl!

I want you to crawl!

Sir, yes, sir!

Now, get out there!

[ shoes screech]

Hut! Hut!

[ shoes screech]

Every good boater needs to know
his vehicle inside and out.

Here. Go take
that boat apart.

I'm impressed, son.

Put it back together again!

[ chuckles]:
Oh, that'll be easy.

Are you sure?

Um, yeah.

You just put the jingamahoos
on the poohickey and, uh...

I might need
a couple of minutes.

[ snoring]It's ready, Sarge!

Jumping jellyfish!

[ bell dings]

[ bell dings]

Watch for pedestrians.
Check mirrors.

Observe that speed limit.

Watch for pedestri... ans!

Whoa!

Aah! Whoa!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Wow! Oh! Oh!

So, um, how'd I do?

How'd you do?

Why don't you ask
the shattered remains

of this pedestrian

how you did?!

Now I know this course forward,
backward and sideways.

Am I ready to get
behind the wheel?

Not quite.

Now do it blindfolded.

[ horn honks, loud crash]

1,003, 1,004, 1,005...

Oh, pebble number 143.

Ha! You will not trip me up
again, pebble number 143.

1,006, 1,007, 1,008...

Old lady with
a ham sandwich.

1,009,

1,010, 1,011,
1,012, one th...

Congratulations.

You're ready to get
behind the wheel.

Really? I'm ready!

I'm ready! I'm...

[ crash]

Let's see what
I taught you, laddie.

Yes, sir!

Left turn at
pebble number 143.

SPONGEBOB:
Kid with a ball.
Nice boy.

Nice driving.

Now parallel park up ahead.

Very good.

Now, boy, the time has come
to show Mr. Fitz

what you learned.
Yes, sir!

Step one: seat belts!

Excellent work, cadet.

What's next?

Step two would be:
ignite engine.

Step three.

Step three would be:

engage blindfold!

What? You can't drive a boat
with a blindfold on.

That's illegal.

But I can't do it
without a blindfold.

Drive, boy! Drive!

[ explosion]

Mayday! Mayday!

You're off course!

[ crashing, banging]

[ rumbling]

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

Oh...

I feel so serene
now that I'm away

from that homicidal maniac,
SpongeBob.

[ horn honks]

The brake, son!

Aye, aye, sir.

Here you go, sir
all I had to do

was unscrew
two little bolts.

I'm going to stop
this thing!

Tell my wife I love her!

Come get some!

Man down! Man down!

[ loud banging]Uh, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

Hey, SpongeBob.Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop
to talk right now.

I can't see!
I can't see!

My pants!

Hey! I can't see.

[ screams]

[ screams]

[ screams]

Did I pass?

Well, if there was
a "destroy the city"

part of the test,
you wouldhave.

The nerve of
some people!

Sorry, SpongeBob,
you failed again.

Even our finest instructor
could not teach you.

Mrs. Puff, you're
hired again.

Hey, Mrs. Puff.

Sorry I'm "unteachable."

It's okay.

Mr. Fitz gave me
my teaching certificate back.

[ sniffles]:
And your dossier was destroyed
in the explosion.

So it's as if
you never failed.

I got you a "welcome back" gift,
Mrs. Puff.

I found all the pieces and
glued them back together.

I promise it won't
take me a million
tries thistime.

BOTH:
It's here!

Behold, Patrick!

The official
Goofy Goober back scratcher!

And it only cost me
52 box tops.

Whoa.

Ooh. Mmhmm.

Oh...

Oh!

Whoo!

Oh, yeah, that's it.

Let me try!

Ahh...

Uh... Patrick,

that's not
the back scratcher.

That's my arm.

Oh. Sorry.

You know, we shouldn't
keep this all to ourselves.

We should let
Squidward try it out.

Yeah!
Onward...

...to Squidward's house!

SQUIDWARD: 
Go away!

To Sandy's house!

Hey, Sandy,
you gotta see this.

Sandy?

What's going on here?

Sandy, are you okay?

[ shuddering, sputtering]

What's wrong, Sandy?

They're coming!
They're coming!

The chimps
are coming?
Who?

My bosses!

They're coming
for an inspection!

I've worked day and night
for a week,

but none of my inventions
are any good.

If I don't have
a real impressive

invention by this afternoon,

they'll cut my funding,

and I'll have to leave
Bikini Bottom.

Oh, come on, Sandy.

I'll bet you invented
lots of useful things.

This helmet looks impressive.

What's it do?

It lets you talk to nuts.
What use is that?

SpongeBob to Peanut.
Come in, Peanut.

[ shortwave radio beeping]

What's it saying?

It says...
"It's dark in here."

Got anything else, Sandy?

There's my
nuttachino machine.

It makes a nice hot, frothy
cup of any nut you choose.

[ grinding, shrieking]

And lastly, my fully
automated nutcracker.

[ beeping]

[ beeping]

Oh! I can't even make
a simple nutcracker.

So, it's got a few bugs.

Patrick and I'll
help you fix it.

Right, Patrick?

Patrick?

[ ecstatic moaning]

Everything'll be fine.

Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob.

I just have to face facts.

I'll be leaving
Bikini Bottom because...

I'm a failure.

We can't let
Sandy leave, Patrick.

What'll we do?

They're looking
for an invention, right?

Right.

So let's start inventing!

Yeah!

It's time to get
serious, Patrick.

Right!

[ crashing]

I made an invention!

It's a stick that you
can draw or write stuff with.

That's a pencil, Patrick.

It's already been invented.

[ crashing]

Ooh! Ooh!
This is a good one.

It's a glass ball
that lights up,

so you can
see in the dark.

Light bulb,
already invented.

[ grunting]
[ crashing]

SpongeBob.
I know this one will work.

I've invented
a parallel universe.

That's a mirror, Patrick.

It's already been invented.

[ groans]

Somebody keeps
stealing my ideas.

[ strange accent]:
Well, I thought it
was a pretty good idea.

[ grunts]

Ohh... I give up.

I'll never invent anything.

[ acoustic guitar plays]

So long, Bikini Bottom

I can't leave without
a goodbye

But please don't think
bad of me

If'n I start to cry

So long, Bikini Bottom

There's so many
things I'll miss

From your smoggy,
crowded city

To your stingin' jellyfish

This town is filled
with many things

That I've come to love

From the birds that fly
upon the ground

To the flowers up above

Farewell, Bikini Bottom

Now, I really hate to go

'Cause the things I'll miss
the most of all

Are the friends
I've come to know.

[ both bawling]

I'm ashamed of
myself, Patrick.

I gave up too quickly.

We'll build Sandy's bosses
an invention so amazing,

they'll give Sandy
funding forever.

[ electrical zapping]

[ small explosion]

[ sloshing]

[ laughing]

We've done it, Patrick!

We created
the greatest invention

the world has ever seen!

Patrick, they're here!

Who?
Sandy's bosses.

The reason we spent
all afternoon inventing.

I have no idea
what you're talking about.

Good day, gentlemen.

Allow me
to introduce ourselves.

I am Professor Percy.

This is Dr. Marmalade.

At your service.

And this is
Lord Reginald.

Charmed.

You guys talk funny.

Say more words!

We are the board
of directors

of Tree Dome
Enterprises Limited,

and we are here
to ascertain

if Miss Cheek's inventions
are up to snuff.

Why, everyone in town
has benefited

from Sandy's scientific
knowledge.

Before Sandy showed up,
I used to be a scrawny weakling.

And I used to be dumb.

[ goofy laughter]

Quite.

And whom do I have
the pleasure of addressing?

My name is SpongeBob.

And I am
Professor Patrick.

Professor?

Doctor Professor Patrick.

Don't mind him.
You know how interns are.

Where is Miss Cheeks?

She should be back
any moment.

I thought she ran away

because she couldn't
invent anything.

Patrick.

That's Mr. Doctor Professor
Patrick to you!

Don't you think it's time
to show them Sandy's invention,

Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?

Good idea.

Well?

Hey, you'rethe unpaid intern.

You do the work.

Gentlemen, I can say
without exaggeration,

that this is the most
important invention

in the history
of the universe.

I give you...

the Automatic
Back Scratcher,

Hair Comber, Nose Picker
and Ukulele Tuner 9000!

This is where our
research money went?

Uhhuh. Isn't it great?

An automatic
backscratcher, haircombing

nosepicking
ukulele tuner.

Yes, well, I've heard thatclaim before.

Yes. How do we know
this contraption works?

Let's see a demonstration.

Step right up.

You look like you've
been neglecting

your personal hygiene.

Me?

Are you sure this is safe?

As sure as I'm
a doctor professor.

Patrick, don't you think
we should test it?

Okay.

[ rumbling]

That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

Lord Reginald,
are you all right?

Oh, I say.

This is splendid.

Oh, absolutely splendid.

What's this? Oh, marvelous.

This machine has evacuated
my nostrils

of unwanted residue
in a manner most pleasant.

Good work, Mr. Doctor
Professor Patrick.

Thank you, lowly assistant.

Oh, I say, now it's feeding me
delicious pudding.

Pudding, I don't remember
that part of the invention.

And now it's tuning
my ukulele.

[ sour note]

[ machine crashing]

Ouch! Ooh!

I say, was that necessary?

You, sir, are impertinent.

Oh, dear.

[ agonized shrieks]

Lord Reginald,
are you all right?

[ shrieks, explosions]

I'm sorry, was that a yes?

Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick,
what is the meaning of this?

It's okay.

The horrible
screaming

means that
it's working.

Oh, I really wish
Sandy were here.

All aboard!

Will this bus
take you somewhere

when you've got
nowhere else to go?

It sure does.

We make stops in Quittersville,

Failuretown and Loserburg.

[ screaming]

What in tarnation?

[ screaming]

What's with all
the monkey business?

[ shrieks]

[ laughing]
Sandy!

SpongeBob.

What the heck
is going on here?

[ thumping]

Ouch.

It works! It works!

Lord Reginald,
are you all right?

I seem to have ruptured
my pomposity.

We shall commence
closure of this establishment

immediately.

Frankly, I'm beginning
to question

the economic benefits
of underwater tree domes.

Doesn't make much sense
when you get right down to it.

I'm sorry, Sandy.

We were trying to keep you
in Bikini Bottom,

but all we did was ruin
your chances to stay.

I was about to be fired anyway.

Thanks for trying
to help, SpongeBob.

You, too, Patrick.

That's Mr. Doctor
Professor Patrick.

Don't push it.

Sorry.

We are departing,
Dr. Marmalade.

My word.
All of this excitement

has drastically reduced
my potassium levels.

Good gracious.

Can it be?

Try it again.

Oh! It is!

It is!

It's the banana peeler

we have been searching
117 years for.

[ excited chattering]

Wow, Sandy, they're going
bananas for your nutcracker.

Yeah.

PERCY: 
Well, Miss Cheeks,

I must say,

you have exceeded expectations.

It may be the extreme
head trauma I've suffered,

but I am going to offer you
a 20year contract

with a substantial pay rise.

I accept.

BOTH:
Hooray!

I expect great things
out of you, Miss Cheeks.

Great things.

Perhaps you could
put your talents

toward that automatic
poopthrowing machine

that's eluded us
for so long.

Now, now.
One miracle at a time.

ALL:
Goodbye.

Well, the only thing left
is to figure out what to do

with this
infernal contraption.

My turn!

Whoohoo!

[ screaming]

All right!

[ bell ringing]

Curse this cursed, ghostly fog.

I can barely see
past me own nose.

Argh.

[ screams]

[ screams]

[ dialing phone]

Hello, roadside assistance?

I've got a bit of a flat!

I'm stuck here while me ship
is being repaired.

Till then, I'm here to haunt ya!

Squidward, help!

Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ooh!

Ow! Oh! Ee! Ee! Ow! Oh!

Squidward, you

SpongeBob, how many times
do I have to tell you

I don't believe in ghosts,
and I never liked you?

Patrick!

Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!

Patrick, you've
got to help me!

The Flying Dutch...man.

Aw, I just wanted

Good night, Gary.

[ sighs]

[ sighs]

Hmm?

[ sighs]

[ laughing evilly]

[ screams]

Hmm?

Um, Dutchie, is this
gonna be much longer?

Why aren't you
freaking out, lad?

Well, you've been here a while,

and, uh, I've seen
all your tricks.

What are you trying to say?

Eh.

I know when I'm washed up.

I've been doing
the same material for years.

Scaring is a young man's game.

It's time to give up the ghost.

No pun intended.

Oh, no, no.

I meant that I'm just
used to it, that's all.

Don't lie to me.

You've just got to scare
someone other than me.

Hmm...

Mind if I test it out?

Yeah, this does
feel comfortable.

[ bell rings]

Could you excuse
me a moment?

[ snoring]

[ growls]

[ mutters]

Grr!

Rah! Rah!

Boo! Rah!

Ah, forget it.

So, what do you think?

[ screams]

[ growls]

It's official.

I'm not scary anymore.

Just what kind
of talk is that?

You're just off your game,
that's all.

Maybe I just need a break.

Take some time off, you know?

Sure, relax a little.

Maybe stay with a friend
for a while.

On a comfy couch in a pineapple.

Just for a little while longer?

Till I get back on me feet?

[ glass breaking]

Hey, champ, how's it...
[ screams]

Turn it up!
Turn the knob up!

Whoo!

Who'd guess we have
so much in common?

You like teddy bears;
I like teddy bears.

You like ponies;
I like ponies.

Is that a wedding ring?

Oh, this?
Oh, it's nothing.

[ laughs]

What is going on around here?!

Come on, SpongeBob,
don't be a stick in the mud.

Look out below!

[ laughs]

[ screams]

How was that?

Even better the third time.

Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no!

Everyone, get out!

All righty, boys,
party's over.

Time to scoot honey.

[ burping]

Dutchie, do you want to spend
eternity on this couch?

Well, it is comfy.

Look in the mirror.

You're a ghost
of your former self.

Ah, you're right,
SpongeBob.

I'm pathetic.

Yes, you are.

But we're going to raise you up
from your squalid condition

through the use of visual aids.

Watch now.

What in barnacles is it?

A journey into selfawareness.

[ screams]

The power within.
The power within.

[ whispering]:
The power within.

[ whispering]:
The power within.

The power within.

The power within.
The power within.

The power within.

[ echoing]:
The power within.

The power within.

The power within!

Yeah!

[ sobbing]

That was beautiful.

Now get off of that couch
and into your clothes, Dutchman.

It's time to get serious.

Let's start you off easy.

You think you can take
that old lady down there?

What, are you kidding me?

Scaring her is too easy.

Now that's
the Flying Dutchman I know.

Let's see you put
those words into action.

No problemo, compadre.

[ thunder]

[ Dutchman screaming]

Yargh!

Lonnie, is that you?

What? No!

'Tis I, the ominous
Flying Dutchman!

[ screams]

Lonnie, there's this great
new product called toothpaste.

I think you
should try it.

Let's hit it!

[ straining]

[ laughs]

Dude, look at your pecs.

You're phenomenal.

Truly a hard body.

Look at those guns.

[ screams]

[ gasps]

[ chuckles]
Now he's got him.

My latissimus dorsi
has gone flabby.

I've got to get
to a rowing machine.

Ah.

It's no use, SpongeBob.

I can't seem to scare anyone.

Maybe people just don't believe
in ghosts anymore.

Wait a minute!

I think you just gave me
the answer to all your problems.

[ whispering]

...goblins...
[ whispering]

...guilt trip...
[ whispering]

[ humming]

[ humming]

Huh?

Squidward!
Squidward!

What's going on?

Why haven't
you called me?

Mother?

Why haven't you
called your mother?

[ screams]

Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.

Why don't you
call me then?

Why don't you call me?
Why don't you call me?

[ clarinet playing]

I heard you don't
believe in ghosts!

Ghosts?

As in the
Flying Dutchman!

[ laughs maniacally]

[ screaming]

There's no such thing as ghosts.

No such things.

No such thing
as ghosts?

No such thing as ghosts?!

You don't believe
in ghosts?!

[ heavy breathing]

SpongeBob?

[ laughs maniacally]

Ooh.

Scary.

No!

No!

That's impossible!

Ghosts! Ghosts!

Dutchie, it worked!

You got your scare back.

And me confidence, too.

Now I feel like I could scare

the living criminy
out of anybody!

All thanks to you, my boy.

And maybe your ship
will be repaired soon.

Actually, I have a
confession, SpongeBob.

My ship's been done
for three months now.

Well, it was nice
rooming with ya.

[ bell ringing]

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

I left you a little something
something for all your trouble.

Now it's high time
for me to ruin more souls.

[ laughs maniacally]

[ gasps]

[ growling]

IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD

THEY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION
TO ME.

IT'S ALL ABOUT ME, ME...

AND GUESS WHO.

ME!

[all gasp]

[gasps]

crash!

NEPTUNE'S TREASURES!

MORNING, DADDY.

ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
PREFER A ROOM

ON THE GROUND FLOOR?

OH, DADDY.

I'M JUST EXCITED BECAUSE
TOMORROW'S A VERY SPECIAL DAY.

[gulps]

IT IS?

OH, I MEAN, IT IS!

VERY SPECIAL!

VERY, VERY SPECIAL INDEED.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAY
TOMORROW IS, DO YOU?

NONE AT ALL.

IT'S MY 16TH BIRTHDAY!

I KNEW THAT.

HOW COULD YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT?

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE, 12?

I'M GOING TO BE 16!

IT'S ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
BIRTHDAY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

IF I DON'T HAVE
A COMPLETELY AWESOME PARTY,

MY WHOLE HIGH SCHOOL REPUTATION
WILL COLLAPSE.

I'LL HAVE TO DROP OUT.

I WON'T GO OFF TO COLLEGE.

I'LL NEVER LEAVE HOME.

YOU'LL HAVE TO SUPPORT ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

[gasps]

WELL,
WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

THEN PROMISE ME YOU'LL GIVE
ME A REAL PARTY THIS YEAR.

AND DON'T BE CHEAP.

[bell ringing]

HI, GIRLS.

HI, PEARL.

ARE YOU GUYS COMING

TO MY TOTALLY CORAL
BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW?

I DON'T KNOW, PEARL.

IS THIS GOING TO BE AS TOTALLY
CORAL AS LAST YEAR

WHEN YOUR DAD PASSED OUT
PAPER CLIPS AS PARTY FAVORS?

[girls laugh]

REMEMBER THE TIME
WE ALL HAD TO SHARE ONE BALLOON?

PLEASE.

REMEMBER THE PONY RIDE?

I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW HE RUINS THIS YEAR.

[laughing]

[sobbing]

DADDY!

[rumbling]
UHOH.

EVERYBODY, BRACE FOR IMPACT!

[rumbling and sobbing,
customers screaming]

TELL ME YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
TOTALLY CORAL

PLANNED FOR MY
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

NOW, NOW,
DON'T SNAP YOUR MIZZENMAST.

EVERYTHING IS ALL SET.

WHY, I'VE ALREADY
GOT THE PARTY FAVORS:

BUBBLE WRAP!

THIS YEAR'S GONNA BE A BLAST.

DADDY, YOU RUINED
ALL MY BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

BUT YOU BETTER NOT
RUIN THIS ONE.

NOW, PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T BE CHEAP.

[gulps]
I PROMISE.

GOOD.

BECAUSE I MADE A LIST.

NOW, I WANT EVERYTHING
ON THIS LIST AT MY PARTY.

BYE.

I'LL BE AT THE MALL
WITH MY FRIENDS.

SPONGEBOB!

YES, MR. KRABS?

WHILE I PLAN THE PARTY,

I WANT YOU
TO BUY PEARL'S PRESENT.

HERE YOU GO, BOY.

WHAT'S THIS, MR. KRABS?

IT'S ME CREDIT CARD.

YOU USE IT INSTEAD OF MONEY.

I CAN BUY STUFF
WITH JUST THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC?

I DON'T NEED MONEY?

EXACTLY.
WHOA.

NOW REMEMBER, NOTHING'S TOO
GOOD FOR ME LITTLE PEARL.

I WANTED TO GIVE HER NOTHING,

[mocking tone]
BUT SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR THAT.

NOW FOLLOW HER AROUND
AND SEE WHAT SHE LIKES.

YOU KNOW,
DO SOME DETECTIVE WORK.

DETECTIVE WORK.

I'M GOING UNDERCOVER.

SO THAT'S WHEN MARCIE
TOLD ME

THAT JULIE SAID
THAT ANGELA DID LIKE BRAD.

OH.

ANGELA LIKES BRAD.

OH, MY GOSH!

THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
I HAVE SEEN

IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

I'D LIKE TO BUY
THAT PIECE OF PLASTIC

WITH THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC.

MR. KRABS, HUH?

QUICK.
HOW DO YOU SPELL "KRABS"?

UM...

I'M PRETTY SURE
IT HAS A "B" IN IT.

CLOSE ENOUGH.

HERE YOU GO, KID.

THAT'S IT?
HUH.

I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
THE WORKINGS OF HIGH FINANCE.

WOW.

THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN

IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

GLITTER GLOSS.

OH, NO.

I BOUGHT THE WRONG PRESENT.

PEARL,
YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS.

COMING, JUDY.

OH...

HMM...

HUH?

NOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
THE GREATEST PRESENT EVER.

[Pearl squealing]

THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

[sighs]

THE BANNER'S UP, MR. KRABS.

I'VE HAD THAT
SINCE THE DAY SHE WAS BORN.

[sniffles]
I GOT IT ON SALE.

I'M SURE SHE'LL LOVE IT,
MR. KRABS.

[blows nose]

THIS SEA PONY
IS THE CUTEST THING EVER.

DO YOU WANT TO COME HOME
AND BE MY PONY?

[panting]
WEE!

[groans]

PEARL, COME HERE.

[all sighing]

OH, ISN'T HE DREAMY?

[scanner beeps]

PRICE CHECK ON FOUR.

MEEP.

I FINISHED PEARL'S PORTRAIT,
MR. KRABS.

IT'S A TRUE MASTERPIECE.

HEY...

MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE HIRED
THAT ICE SCULPTOR.

ICE SCULPTOR?

ANY FOOL CAN SCULPT IN ICE.

IT TAKES TRUE GENIUS

TO TRANSFORM 400 POUNDS
OF RAW KRABBY PATTIES

INTO A WORK OF SUCH MAJESTY.

YEAH.

WELL,
WE'VE GOT THE DECOR COVERED.

NOW, HOW ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT?
LET ME SEE HERE.

PEARL WANTS SOME BOY BAND
CALLED BOYS WHO CRY.

BOYS WHO CRY?

THEY'RE MY FAVORITE BAND.

THEY CHARGE A MILLION DOLLARS
JUST TO SHOW UP.

IF YOU WANT THEM TO LIPSYNC,
IT'LL RUN INTO REAL MONEY.

YOU'RE A REAL FAN, HUH?

OH, YEAH.

I KNOW ALL THEIR SONGS.

HMM.

ALL THEIR SONGS?

beep!
chaching!

beep!
chaching!

[beeping and cash register
dinging repeatedly]

WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF MY DAD
GOT ME THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

IT SURE WOULD BE,
IF HE WAS COOL...

WHICH HE'S NOT.
[girls laughing]

YEAH, HE PROBABLY GOT ME
ANOTHER BOX OF STAPLES.

IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE PARTY TO START.

I'M BACK, MR. KRABS.

HOWDY, MASTER UDON.
SANDY CHEEKS.

I DO A LITTLE KARATE MYSELF.

SANDY, SANDY, SANDY.

MR. UDON ISN'T INTERESTED
IN A KARATE NOVICE LIKE YOU.

HE ONLY HAS TIME FOR ROYALTY.

OH, BROTHER.

PLEASE,
SHOW ME SOME OF YOUR MOVES,

MASTER SPONGEBOB.

YOU HEAR THAT, SANDY?
HE CALLED ME "MASTER."

BRING ON YOUR BEST FIGHTERS!

I'LL TRY TO GO EASY ON THEM.

HIYAH!

[thugs growling]

SPONGEBOB,
YOUR KARATE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

TO HANDLE THOSE SIDEWINDERS.

PASHAW!

WATCH AND LEARN, SISTER.

[shouts indistinctly]

[groaning]

[last breath sputters]

YUP, THAT'S HOW
THE KING OF KARATE DOES IT.

WHO'S NEXT?

SOMETHING SMELLS

COME, SANDY,

TAKE YOUR PLACE
NEXT TO THE KING

AND SHARE
IN MY CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT.

clap!
clap!

BRING A SEAT
FOR MY AIRBREATHING FRIEND.

SPONGEBOB,
Y'ALL ARE GETTING A BIT WILY.

OH, DO I DETECT
A NOTE OF JEALOUSLY, SANDY?

HECK, I COULD KARATE YOU
INTO A COUNTRY FIDDLE

WITH ONE PAW
TIED BEHIND MY BACK.

[laughing]

BUT WHO'S BEING CROWNED
KING OF KARATE?

NOT YOU.

I'M GETTING OFF
THIS CRAZY TRAIN!

[mumbling]

MASTER, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HER.

SHE IS MISSING OUT ON THE
OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

[laughs]

LET THE CORONATION BEGIN!

SANDY'S GONNA MISS OUT
BIGTIME.

[gasps]

click!

THAT DANG SPONGEBOB.

WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

I TAUGHT THAT YELLOW EGOMANIAC

EVERYTHING HE KNOWS
ABOUT FIGHTING,

AND THAT AIN'T MUCH.

NO!

SPONGEBOB'S IN TROUBLE!

[SpongeBob continues screaming]

SPONGEBOB IS
THE "KING OF KARATE."

HE DOESN'T NEED ME.

EH, HE CAN HANDLE THIS HIMSELF.

SANDY, I NEED YOU!

I CAN'T HANDLE THIS MYSELF!

HOLD ON, BUDDY!

NO!

SANDY!

SHE WILL NEVER REACH YOU.

SHE MUST FIRST PASS THROUGH...

[screaming]

THE FOUR FLOORS OF FEAR.

SPONGEBOB?

HA.

HAHAHA.

YOU CANNOT PASS

UNLESS YOU DEFEAT ME,
THE TICKLER,

AND MY IRONFINGER STYLE.

HAHA!

HAHA.

LOOK!
HUH?

[giggling]

PREPARE FOR
THE TICKLING OF YOUR LIFE!

TASTE THESE!

OH, NO!

HOW DID YOU KNOW
THEY WERE MY WEAKNESS?

NO ONE CAN RESIST JELLYFILLED.

HIYAH!

HIYAH!

HIYAH!
HIYAH!

HIYAH!

STICKY AROUND.

I'LL BE BACK WITH THE GLAZED.

I COULD USE A WETNAP.

ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?

HALT.

NO ONE ADVANCES PAST ME,

DYNAMOLIP THRUSTER STYLE.

HIYAH!

DANCE, SQUIRREL!

THAT'S ENOUGH LIP OUT OF YOU.

[crunching]

[shatters]

WHAA!

NO ONE HAS EVER MADE IT

NO ONE PASSES EXCEPT ME.

NOW, FEEL THE STING
OF MY HORRIBLE BODY ODOR!

[grunting]

[pinging]

HAHA, PHIL!

YOUR FOUL STENCH CAN'T PERMEATE
MY FRESHAIR DOME.

FRESHAIR DOME?

[inhaling]

MAN.

I REALLY DO STINK.

HIYAH!

YOU ARE
ONE IMPRESSIVE SQUIRREL.

YOU EVEN MADE A COSTUME CHANGE.

RELEASE SPONGEBOB!

NEVER.

thud!

[grunting]

HE IS FORBIDDEN TO LEAVE
UNTIL...

HE SIGNS THIS CONTRACT.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
REAL ESTATE.

YOU MEAN THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A SCAM

TO GET US TO BUY REAL ESTATE?

YES.

IF THERE WAS
A REAL KARATE ISLAND,

I'D BE A MILLIONAIRE.

YOU MEAN
I'M NOT KING OF KARATE?

NO.

BUT YOU COULD BE KING OF CONDOS.

HERE, LET ME EXPLAIN.

IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

YOU SEE,

IF YOU INVEST IN A TIMESHARE
HERE ON CONDO ISLAND,

YOU CAN SEE YOUR EQUITY INCREASE
TENFOLD.

PERHAPS YOU
AND YOUR YELLOW FRIEND

WOULD LIKE TO SET UP
A TIMESHARE PLAN?

DON'T DO IT, SANDY!

[chanting indistinctly]

HIYAH!

I WON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR
TIMESHARE VACATION SCAM!

THEN GIVE IN TO MY FISTS.

[grunting]

[grunting]

HIYAH!

[roars]

[smacking and groaning]

[screams]

[screams]

[screams]

[screaming]

splash!

YOU'RE IN THE SOUP NOW, UDON!

SANDY, I'M SORRY
I ACTED LIKE A JERK BACK THERE.

THANKS FOR SAVING ME FROM...

gulp!

BUYING A CONDO.

OH, SHUCKS, SPONGEBOB,
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

I STILL HAVE ONE QUESTION,
THOUGH.

DOES THIS MEAN
I'M NOT KING OF KARATE ANYMORE?

YOU ARE IN MY BOOK, SPONGEBOB.

YOU ARE IN MY BOOK.

NOW, LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT REAL ESTATE.

IT'S ALL ABOUT LOCATION...

I'M HERE!

Well, we'd better
get back to work.

Work?

How could I go back to work
without...

without Spat?!

Use another spatula.

What?!

There is only one spatula
for me,

and that is Spat.

Spat, wait up! Spat!

I'm coming, Spat!

[ beeping]

Oh, Spat.

We've been through
so much together.

[ sizzling]

[ sizzling]

[ laughing]

Oh...

uhhuh...

[ clanking]

[ laughing]

[ screaming]

[ laughing]

There's no easy way
to say this.

SpongeBob, if I were you,

I would give serious
consideration

to start thinking about...
a replacement spatula.

[ whimpering]

Go home, get some rest.

We'll... try to do
everything we can.

Thank you, Doctor.

Oh, I'm not a doctor.

I'm an actor
researching for a role.

Yes! Whoohoo!

I am so totally
gonna get this part!

[ sighs]

[ sniffling]

Replacement spatula?

How could anything
ever replace...

Hey, look at that!

Ooh!

Looks fancy.

So shiny...

Oh, those lines, so... sleek.

What am I talking about?

I don't need this!

Maybe I do need this.

I would give serious
consideration to...

[ gong chimes]

...a replacement spatula.

Ow!

Uhuh. No touchytouchy
the Le Spatula.

It's very, very
expensive.
I'm sorry.

Of course, if you
purchase this fine item,

you may... hold it.

Well, I've got some
loose change in my pocket.

Will this cover it?

Um....

mm, mm, mm...
mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...

No.

How about now?

No.

Now?

No.

Now?No.

Now?
No.

That's everything I have.

Now can I buy Le Spatula?

Everything, huh?

Nice outfit.

[ singing happily]

Good evening, sir.

Yaah!

[ whistling]

Hmph!

Oh!
Hey, Granny,
what's shakin'?

[ singing]

[ continues singing]

Mm, breezy today, heh.

Nice outfit, SpongeBob!

[ snorting, guffawing]

Thanks, Squidward.

It was worth
every penny.

What's all
the lollygagging about?!

Mr. Krabs,
get a load of SpongeBob!

[ cackling]This better be good!

[ singing happily]

Soon everyone will know
of your beauty.

All right,
what's going on in... Oh!

Don't you have
any shame, boy?

All my shame went in here,
Mr. Krabs.

KRABS:
Le Spatuler!

What in blazes isthat?

Oh, just the answer to our
little production dilemma.

Well, what can it do?

Can it make me famous?

Anything you want and more!

Ooh, that sounds exciting.

Let me have a go at it!

Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs,
no can do.

What?! Are you going against
your commanding officer?

No, it's not that.

It's just that this is a highly
developed piece of engineering

that takes quality time
to master.

With that fancy machinery,
I expect you

to make Krabby Patties
twice as fast.

Oh, I don't think
that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs.

In fact...

[ French accent]:
Le Spatula 3000,

at your service.

Huh! Impressive.

Well, let's see that thing
impress me even more

by bringing in
more customers

and more money
in me pocket.

[ chuckling]

Oh, you won't believe what
Le Spatula is capable of.

Ready to show 'em, buddy?

Oh, it's okay,
no need to be shy.

It's always tough
the first day on the job.

Uh, can I get one
Krabby Patty, please?

SpongeBob, I need
one Krabby Patty.

One Krabby Patty coming up
licketysplit.

Huh?

Spat, is there
something wrong, pal?

I would not dare touch such slop
as this, how you say,

Krabby Patty!

I am designed for the utmost
in culinary cuisine.

No less!

But... but I thought
we were friends.

Friends with you? Ha!

We are not even
in the same social class!

Have a nice life of mediocrity,
fry cook!

[ wild laughter]

Le Spatula, wait!

I gave up everything for you!

We had something!

How's thatfor something?

Au revoir, peasant!

Have fun ladling
in your greasy spoon!

[ spits loudly]

What happened?!

My spatula's gone, Mr. Krabs!

But how are you
gonna flip Krabby Patties

without a spatuler?!

I hada spatula once,

a realspatula,

one that stood by me
through thick and thin,

through grease and gristle,

and I betrayed his loyalty...

like a fool!

I always did like
your old spatuler.

He got the job done
right every time.

[ gasps]:
You're right, Mr. Krabs.

The truemeasure of a good
spatula is by his actions,

not by some fancy chrome
and buttons!

I've got to find my old spatula!

Go to him!
Go now, boy!

Go before I lose
all me customers!

[ sobbing]

[ beeping]

[ steady tone]

Spatula?

It can't be true!

[ crying]:
It's too late!

SpongeBob, I... I
hate to tell you this.

I know! He's moved on to that
big kitchen drawer in the sky!

[ sniffles]:
He's... gone!

Actually,
it's not that.

I didn't get
the acting part.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

[ sobbing]Oh, by the way,

that's not your spatula.

Your buddy's all patched
up in the infirmary.

[ gasps]:
Spatula!

Old buddy!
Oh, I'm so glad you're better!

[ squeaks]

Spatula, what's wrong?

[ squeaks]

But I didn't mean to betray you.

Mr. Krabs needed a replacement.

Krabby Patties don't flip
themselves, you know.

It was a moment
of weakness!

[ sobbing]:
I'm sorry!

Oh, what have I done?!

What have I done?!

[ loud sobbing]

[ loud blubbering]

All that glitters is not gold.

[ sobbing]

Goodbye, best friend!

[ sobbing]

[ sobbing]

[ sobbing]

[ sobbing, wailing]

I'll never find
another spatula like him again.

[ sizzling]

Spatula?

You're back!

[ romantic orchestral music 
plays]

Oh, Spatula,
now that we're together again,

nothing will ever separate us.

One Monster Krabby Patty.

Okay, buddy, we can do this.

Ready? One... two...

three!

[ loud snap]

Ooh! [ laughing]

[ SpongeBob laughing]

Nothing. Ah, well.

[ clinking]

That sounds like a quarter
crying for help.

Come to papa!

Hold it right there, buddy.

My son just dropped
that quarter.

Yeah? Well, that kid
looks pretty shifty to me.

How do I know
he didn't steal it?

[ groans]

Hey!

That little brat's throwing
perfectly good money away!

Oh, so if I
can't have it,

no one...

I hope he throws all your
retirement money down a hole!

Poor little quarter.

What the...?

This well is full of money!

Don't worry, little fellas!

I'll save you!

[ grunting]

Oh, it's no use.

Me poop deck's too big.

Make a wish, dear.

All my wishes
have already come true.

Oh, you.

No!

I'll save you, money!

Gotcha!

What do you heartless
brutes think you're doing?!

Um, using the wishing well.

Well, you toss in a coin
and make a wish.

And then what?

And that's it.

Nothing else happens.It's fun!

You mean suckers throw
money down a hole for fun?

That's the greatest scam ever!

Can we have our
quarter back now?

SQUIDWARD: 
SpongeBob,

why aren't those
patties ready?

You can't rush
perfection.

I'm not rushing perfection.

I'm rushing you!

[ laughing]

Always the kidder,
Squidward.

[ grumbles]

Oh, this job stinks!

But at least I'm not
digging ditches.

KRABS:
Squidward! SpongeBob!

I got a new job for you.

KRABS:
X marks the spot

of the Eugene Krabs memorial
wishing well.

A wishing well,
here?! Wow!

Don't you have to be dead
to have a memorial anything?

Oh, Squidward,
don't you believe in magic?

Yeah, Squidward, don't
you believe in magic?

No, I don't!

And neither does Mr. Krabs!Well, I do.

This well's gonna make a
lot of dreams come true.

What's the first thing
you're gonna wish for?

To be as far away
from you as possible.

Come on, SpongeBob, this hole's
not gonna dig itself.

And I'm certainly
not gonna do it.

Squidward, aren't
you excited?

This is really
gonna help people.

Take a penny
and some magic

Even though your
life is tragic
Hey!

You can throw all your dreams
down the well

Although every day,
the pain grows

You'll ride unicorns
on rainbows

If you throw all your dreams
down the well

When your life's come apart
at the seams

And you've given up
all your dreams

Here is just the means

To make those dreams
come true

No more sufferin',
no more sighin'

Ow!No more pain and
no more cryin'

I'm not crying!When you throw all your
dreams down the well

Well, Squidward,
what do you think?

That was the worst song
I ever heard.

But at least
this stupid well's finished.

It's beautiful!

[ sniffing]
You smell that, boys?

That's the
smell of money!

You mean magic,
don't you?

All I can smell
is that Dumpster.

[ flies buzzing]

All right, Squidward, you
can go back to the register.

As long as
there's no singing.

And I've got a date
with a Krabby Patty.

Hold on there,
SpongeBob.

Let me show you
your new station.

It's kind of
a promotion.

Sort of.

A promotion?!

Why do I have to go
down in the well?

To collect the money!

How long do I
have to stay down here?

See you in eight hours.

Thanks for the promotion.

It sure is dark
and scary in here.

[ teeth chattering]

I sure wish I had
a fancy telescope.

One that works
underwater.

That'd make me happier
than a june bug

at a porch light sale.

Our very first wish.

I can't wait till
it comes... Oh!

I have presented you
with a monetary offering,

as custom dictates.

My wish, nay, my command,

is to be taller.

Just a little.

Just big enough
to crush my enemies

like the vermin they are!

Gosh... Ow!

I wish I had a snazzy new boat.

I want to be a hotrod mama.

[ gasps]

[ slurping]

Hey!

Oh, my gosh!
Who said that?

Patrick...!

How do you know my name?

Patrick, this is a wishing well.

Just throw in a coin
and make a wish.

Okay, magical
talking trashcan.

[ coins jingling]

I wish SpongeBob
were here to see this.

Patrick...?!

Hi, SpongeBob.

I got my wish.

Patrick, you're
supposed to let go

of the coin
when you throw it.

But I got my wish.

Well, we got six
and a half hours

till the end of my shift.

What do you
want to do now?

Tag! You're it.
Tag,
you're it.

Tag! You're it.

Tag! You're it.
Tag,
you're it.

Tag,
you're it.
Tag! You're it.

Tag! You're it.

SpongeBob, what kind
of haul did you get?

I did great, Mr. Krabs.

I got a nickel from Sandy,
two pennies from Mrs. Puff,

a penny from Plankton, and this
slightly used pair of dentures.

And I fell on my head.

Well, I can probably get
a couple of bucks for Patrick.

Nah.

You better just
send up the money.

This wishing well was a
wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs.

Has anyone's wish come true yet?

Uh... not yet.

But I'm sure, if you believe
strong enough,

and dug deep enough,

everyone's wishes
will come true.

Really?

Yeah, sure, whatever.

Can we come out now?

Goodness, no.

You gotta stay down there

just in case any latenight
wishers come by.

I'll be back for you at dawn.

Oh... no one's wishes
are coming true.

What did we do wrong?

I know I believe hard enough.

Maybe I just
didn't dig deep enough.

What do you say, Patrick?

Are you ready to dig
for some magic?

Yeah!

Oh, the magic
has gone missin'

And everyone's still wishin'

But their dreams have fallen
flat upon the ground

You'll find magic
under rubble

So, Patrick, grab a shovel

And here is where
the magic can be found

We're at the bottom
of a well

But, man, won't it be swell

When we make everyone's wishes
all come true?

Holy mackerel!

Look, Patrick!

We've struck magic!

Is that good?

Next to being a fry cook,

it's the most important
thing I've ever done.

It's the only thing
I've ever done.

SQUIDWARD:
Having fun down there,
SpongeBob?

[ laughing]

Hi, Squidward.Patrick's down there, too?

It just gets
better and better.

Do you want
to make a wish?

Ha! Ha! I got mywish.

You two are stuck in a dark hole
and away from me.

Guess what, Squidward?

We found the magic.

[ laughing]

There's no magic, SpongeBob.

Wishing wells are just a scam
to fool saps like you.

[ laughing]

No, it's true.

We didfind the magic.

Oh, I wish you
could see it.

Ha, ha, ha... oop!

Squidward, you decided
to join the party.

Party!

Let me outta here.

We were just gonna
play some party games.

Tag! You're it.Tag! You're it.

Tag!
You're it.
I gotta
get outta here.

Go, Squidward!
Go, Squidward!

Go, Squidward!
Go, Squidward!

[ screaming, groaning ]

There's no way
to climb outta here.

Maybe if you had more
upperarm strength.

Yeah, you should
work out more.

Well, why don't I just start
right now?

After all, I got a couple
of dumbbells right here.

[ laughing]

I don't get it.

Would you not
stand so close?

You're making me
claustrophobic.

What does
claustrophobic mean?

It means he's afraid
of Santa Claus.

No, it doesn't!

Ho, ho, ho!

[ giggling]

Stop it, Patrick,
you're scaring him!

Ho! Ho! Ho!

It's not working, Patrick.

Darn.

Um, Squidward,

You're standing
on my foot.

Oops. Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.

And you got your elbow
in my ribs.

Eww.

Patrick.

And stop stepping
in my potato salad.

Hey, hey, hey. Guys!

Stop pushing me, Patrick.

You mean like this?

No, like this!

[ slugging]

You shouldn't
fight in here.

This is a magical place.

Patrick,
get off of me!

[ slugging continues]

I told you I am claustrophobic.

Nice try, Squidward,

but there's
no Santa Claus here.

SQUIDWARD:
Patrick!

Good morning, SpongeBob!

Let's see what you got.

Boy, it's heavy!

Must be a lot of money.

Free! I'm free!

Squidward? What were you
doing down there?

I didn't approve
any overtime.

Or were you sneaking here,
in the dead of night,

for free wishes?

The only thing I wish for
is to be far away from here.

Ow.

Bye, Squidward.

Enjoy your trip.

Lucky.

So how much money
did you make last night?

We didn't get any money,

but we found
something better.

We found the magic.

The what?

We dug down deeper in the well
and found the magic!

Now all the wishes
will come true.

Listen closely, SpongeBob.

You don't get what you want in
life just by wishing for it.

[ shrieking]

What in the deep blue is that?

There's a full moon out tonight.

Do you like my new
telescope I wished for?

That's great, Sandy.

That wishing well
sure does work.

Just a coincidence.

What do you think
of my new hotrod?

It's beautiful,
Mrs. Puff.

How's about letting me
take it for a spin?

[ both laughing]

No.

See, Mr. Krabs?
She wished for that boat.

You mean she stole
that boat.

Morning, SpongeBob, Krabs.

Beautiful day.

[ crazed laughter]

Is that proof enough for you?

You'll never get me
to believe in magic. Never!

Just to prove it to you,

I'll demonstrate.

I wish I was steamed

and served with a side
of melted butter.

[ laughing]

Mr. Krabs! No!

Well, where's your
magic now?

Oh, where am I?

What's going on here?

Uhoh.

I dobelieve in magic.

I do believe in magic.
I do believe in magic.

Oh, no...!

I surrender!

Eh?

I wonder what form
of trickery

is up that miniature
cyclops' sleeve this time.

All right, Plankton,

I don't know what
you're trying to pull on me,

but I'll tell you right now
it ain't gonna work!

There's no pulling, Krabs.

Can't you see my peace offering?

What is this?

Haha!

Very funny, Plankton!

But you're gonna have to do
a lot better

than taking a stab
at my illiteracy to offend me!

Don't you get it, Krabs?

I give up.

I'm through competing with you!

But what about all
those fevered attempts

at trying to steal my
Krabby Patty recipe?

Exactly! They've all been
just attempts,

and every single one
a miserable failure!

I can feel my arteries
clogging up with anxiety

just thinking about it.

[ sighs]:
Let me show you something.

Look at this place!

Aah! Crimony, Plankton!

You ever hear
of spring cleaning?

What's the point?

Do you know when the last time
I had a customer was?

Actually, I can't recall
you everhaving a customer.

Well, there he is!

That's why I've decided to quit

the restaurant business
altogether

and turn the Chum Bucket into...

this!

You want to turn
your restaurant
into a pile of junk?

No! These are knickknacks...

for the new gift shop
I'm opening up!

[ laughing]

Come on, this has got to be
a joke, right?

I'm serious, Krabs.

Soon the Chum Bucket will be
a nice little store

for bricabrac and bubblegum.

All right, Plankton,
but be aware:

I'm not letting me guard down.

Guard away, my exenemy.

I'll just be here starting
my new competitionfree career.

[ singing happily]

[ muttering]

What's going on,
Mr. Krabs?

Plankton's concocted
another hairbrained scheme

to steal me recipe
so keep your eyes peeled.

Whatever you say, Cap'n!

Now, that's an employee
who follows orders.

[ rumbling]

What in blazes is that noise?

Ah, would you look at that!

I have a feeling I'm gonna like
this new life of novelty items.

Uhhuh! Clever, Plankton!

Two can play at this game!

Mr. Krabs,

look at this cool knickknack
I got at the Chumporium!

Hmm. I know there's a microphone
or camera in here somewhere.

[ grunting]

Uh, Mr. Krabs,
I really don't think

there's anything weird in there.

Eh, we'll see about that.

I'll just put this in here
for safekeeping.

You hear, Plankton?

Join your other friend
from the past!

Now nobody's getting
to see anything!

Don't you understand?

This is all part of his ruse
it's just cosmetic.

He thinks
he can fake us out.

But we'll show him.

We're gonna outfake
the faker! Haha!

[ loudly]:
Well, it looks like
old Plankton's

really going through with it.

I guess we don't have to worry
about himanymore.

Yep, we sure whipped him
this time.

Okay, boys, the coast is clear!

Plankton's turned over
a new leaf!

That's some good
news, Mr. Krabs!

It sure is, you little halfwit.

And you know what else
is good news?

We can finally use
that deejay system.

Hit it, SpongeBob!

Right away, sir!

Let's party!

[ percussive dance music plays]

[ needle scratching 
rhythmically]

[ dance music playing]

Ow! I won!

It's time to boogie!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

This is idiotic.

Dance or you're fired.

You got it, Mr. Krabs.

[ rumbling]

How do you like themapples,
you little...

[ record needle scratches, 
music stops]

[ humming happily]

Come on, buddy,
let's get some shuteye.

We've got a big day ahead of us
at the Chumporium Gift Shop.

Wait a minute!

What the...?

Store shelves?

Novelty toys?

Lava lamps?!

[ squeaky gasp]

Useless knickknacks?!

Very convincin'...

but I'm still not buying it!

You want a battle, Plankton?

I'm gonna give you a war!

[ Plankton singing happily]

[ singing, laughing]

Ah, a clean snow globe
is a happy snow globe.

[ chuckles]

Plankton!

You may have fooled
everyone else,

you might have even
fooled yourself,

but you ain't foolin' me!

Oh. [ chuckles]

I get it
you caught me redhanded.

[ chuckles]

[ long sigh]

Those were the days,
huh, Eugene?

[ angry grunting]

But I found
there was more to life

than just trying to steal
your formula.

I found it all right here,
in novelty items.

Bupkes!

Oh, Eugene...

stuck in your old ways.

Bupkes! If there's one thing
that is certain in this world,

it's that you can't resist
me formula!

You know

you want it.

Thanks... but no.

Uhhuh! Uhhuh! I knew it!

It was all a trick to get me
to hand over me...

Wait. Did you say... no?

Well, if you don't believe me,
that's yourproblem, not mine.

Problem?!
I don't have a problem!

You're the one with the problem!

Look at this.

It means nothing!

It's all a facade! A hoax!

Oops.

What's this?

PLANKTON:
Hey, Krabs!

Huh? What?
I knew you'd come back.

You forgot
something.

Can't you understand,
I've wasted so much time

chasing after you, and now
I have something that's mine.

And it makes me... happy.

I never thought I'd see the day.

What happened to
the invertebrate I usedto know?

Plankton!

[ phone ringing]

[ continues ringing][ knobs squeaking]

Coming, coming.

Whew!

Yo.

Uh, Plankton?Eugene?

Uh... hey.

Hey.

Listen, uh,
I just wanted to...

you know... apologize
for my behavior today.

Wasn't right what I done, and...

and I realized I hurt
the feelings of, uh...

[ clears throat, 
coughs nervously]

...of, uh, someone I care about.

You still there?

Yeah.

I'm still here.

[ chuckles]:
Good.

Uh...

I want to make it up to you.

What do you say we grab a soda?

Sure.

Glad you could
make it, buddy.

So... what's this about, Krabs?

I thought that since we're
no longer archenemies,

maybe...

maybe we can...
start over?

Yes.

Yes, I would like that
very much.

I guess I won.

[ both laughing]

Uh, I don't know about this,
Plankton.

Oh, come on, just fall back.

Trust me, I'll catch you.
[ chuckles]

[ creaking]

[ whistling through air]

[ grunting with effort]

[ grunting]

[ gasping breaths]

That was truly amazing,
Plank, old buddy.

I guess I really can
trust you 100%.

Thanks, Eugene.

That... means a lot to me.

And just to prove it to you,

I want you
to have something.

No, no, come on,
now, no gifts.

No, no. I want you
to have this.

It's me secret formula.

I can't believe
you would even think...

But things are different now.

Honestly,
it would mean a lot to me.

You... you're serious.

[ sniffling]

Eugene, if I take this formula
from you now,

there will always be
a hint of doubt.

Come on, take it.

You sure?

[ sighs]

Life is good, Krabs.

Sure is, buddy.

Sure is.

Yeah, baby!

This is it!

Yeah!

Whoo! Whoohoohoo!

[ laughing loudly]

Yeah!

I got it! I got it!

My diabolical, extremely
convoluted plan worked!

I should have been a politician.

[ laughing]

I'd never give
you the formula!

[ Krabs laughing]

I fooled you with an even more
convoluted charade!

[ laughing]

[ Plankton yelling]

[ chirping]

What a suntastic day!

Whoa!

Snail trail.

That SpongeBob needs to keep
his pet out of my yard.

I am sick of cleaning up
after him.

[ muttering]

Not my pet rock collection.

[ blubbering]

That's it!

This isn't the first time
you've soiled my yard

with your revolting
excretions.

But mark this down
in your little notebook.

It will be the last time!

Ow!

This cheap splintery wood
will keep even Gary out.

Now I feel safe.

[ squishing]

Huh?

SpongeBob!

Hi, Squidward.

[ calm voice]:
Hey, SpongeBob.

[ yelling]:
Keep your shell vermin
off of my property!

Then next time, my annoyingly
yellow neighbor,

your wet pet oozes
on my lawn,

you'll leave me
no choice

but to call snail control.

That little monster...

[ sputtering][ growling]

He bit me!

Gary!

No, dirty boy.

This isn't like you.

Oh, but it's just
like you, SpongeBob,

to raise such
a misbehaved mollusk.

Gary's not
misbehaved.

[ snarling]

But there does appear
to be something wrong with him.

I'll say.
I hope he's
had his shots.

Oh, of course.

All of his shots?

Affirmatory.

For rabies?Yep.

Snail pox and soft shell dance?Yupie.

Bagitis, lumpybump trump,
teen angst?Yep, yep, yep.

Let's not forget
the worst of them all.

Mad snail disease.

Uh...

You mean your pet
hasn't been vaccinated

for mad snail disease?

Looks like the rash
has already started.

Rash?

Tell me, do you have
any soreness of throat?

[ gulps]

Well, now that you
mention it

my throat is
a little dry.

This disease will ravage
your body

with bloodshot eyes,
loss of balance,
Whoa.

messy pants,

ticklish rib cage,[ laughing]

severely untrimmed
toenails

and finally, the bite
from that infected snail

will turn you
into...

A zombie.

[ screaming]

You need to get that snail
of yours to a doctor

before he bites
someone important.

[ both gasp]

There's a mad snail
on the loose!

[ screaming]

Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?!

[ screaming]

The mad snail is coming!

If he bites you,
you'll turn into
a zombie.

Jeepers, what's with
all the lunatics?

Oh, look, honey,
isn't he the cutest?

[ panting]

Come here,
little buddy.

He's just adorable.

Mad snail disease is real!

I'm a zombie.
I've been bitten
by a mad snail.

I've got mad
snail disease!

Then I've got it!
A snail just bit me, too!

[ both screaming]

[ screaming]

[ all screaming]

We interrupt this program
to bring you a news blast.

This just in...

Fear and disease is spreading
like wildfire

as a killer snail has been
biting the denizens

of Bikini Bottom.

Infecting them with...

Ask any old fish on the street
and they'll tell you

that germs enter through
the bite radius.

Traveling upstream until
the entire host body

is full of...

We now take you to Action News
Reporter Perch Perkins

live on the scene.

Perch Perkins here with
with the first victim

of this epidemic.

Tell me, Mr. Tentacles,
when did you first

begin to suspect
you were a zombie?

Well, after I was bitten
by a mad snail

I began to get a rash.

Followed by loss of balance,
ticklish rib cage

and a few other symptoms.

Hey, I was bitten
by a snail.

I kind of feel
off balance.

Whoa.

Hey, I have ticklish
ribs, too.

And I haven't even
been bitten.

Oh, no, it's spreading
through the air!

[ all screaming]

Well, you heard it
here first.

We're all doomed
to a horrible demise,

thanks to a diseased snail.

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

[ all screaming]

Gary?

[ horns honking]

I can't believe that sweet
and slimy snail

would cause all this
destruction.

[ Squidward moaning]

I'm a zombie,

here to dine on your
squishy yellow flesh.

[ moaning]

[ gasps]

[ all moaning]

[ screaming]

[ screaming]

It's locked!

[ moaning]

Somebody let me in.

SpongeBob, come in, boy.

And bring your friendsin, too.

They lookhungry.

Stop! You can't
let anyone in!

But they just want to dine
on some krabby patties.

They're zombies.

They only want to dine
on our flesh.

All right, but it's coming
out of your paycheck.

I don't work here.

But, Mr. Krabs,
it's me SpongeBob.

But how do we know
you haven't become

one of those voracious
flesheaters?

Could a voracious
flesheater do this?

SpongeBob, it's you.

That's right,
so let me in
before I'm eaten.

Yeah, that's SpongeBob
all right.

Or is it?Huh?

I don't believe that's
the real SpongeBob.

He looks pretty
zombiefied.

Just look at how
yellow he is.

Come on, Patrick, would a zombie
have a picture of his best buddy

in his wallet?

Perhaps not.

But I've got
my eye on you.

If you could pull out your eye
and put it on him,

wouldn't that make you

a zombie, too?

[ all gasping]

You're right.

I'm a zombie!

Who's to say we're not
all zombies?

[ screaming]

[ all gasping]

ALL:
The snail!

Gary!

Are you okay, buddy?

Come here, boy.

No, don't get near it.

Oh, the pity of it all.

I can't watch.

All those people think
you're a monster,

but I know you're
just a snail.

[ barking]

[ all gasping]

[ belches]

Gary...

[ sniffling]

...how could you?

[ snarling]

SpongeBob's been infected
by his own pet snail.

Oh, the irony.

Quick, we must quarantine
that infected snail

before he bites
every last Bikini Bottomite.

Let's get that snail.

ALL:
Yeah!

[ angry shouting]

No, don't hurt him.

Hand over the snail.

It's for his own good,
SpongeBob.

No, I won't let you
touch Gary.

Stop the madness,
man.

The mad snail disease
ends now.

Seize the snail.

Halt!

Did someone say
mad snail disease?

Is that what all this fuss
is about?

Yeah. What do you
know about it?

Funny you should ask.

Allow me to introduce myself.

Dr. Gill Gilliam.

S.D.E. + S.E.

"S.D.E. + S.E."?

Snail disease expert
and snail expert.

I'm sorry to break
this to you all,

but that "mad snail disease"
you're talking about

it doesn't exist.

ALL:
Huh?

That's right, no such thing.

It's an old urban legend,
a myth.

Well, does that mean
we're not zombies?

Of course not.

No one is.

It's just mass hysteria.

But what about my severely
untrimmed...?

Those are only
moderately untrimmed.

All the supposed symptoms
are just common ailments.

Easy, boy.

But what about Gary then?

If he doesn't have
a disease,

why'd he bite
all those people
including me?

Hmm?

Uhhuh, the problems
right here.

He's got
a little splinter

in his foot.

I'm sure this was causing
him distemper.

Making for serious
grouchy snailitis.

Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't
diseaseridden.

Do you still love me?

Meow.

[ laughing]

Good old Gary's back.

[ moaning]

Hey, Squidward,
you're not a zombie, remember?

Oh, yes, I am.

Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

May I take your order?

All's well that ends well.

MR. KRABS:
Squidward! SpongeBob!

Just put me
out of me misery!

Why, Mr. Krabs?

What could be wrong
on such a fine day?

Fine?

Today's not the day
for that word, boy.

Not after I received
this letter

from the fry
cooks' union.

It says here: "Fry cook,
SpongeBob SquarePants

has accumulated too much
vacation time."

And if you don't
take some time off,

I'll have to pay a fine!

Time off?

Oh, I guess there's just no
other way to say this.

SpongeBob,
take a vacation.

Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.

Well, that went better
than I expected.

I'm ready, vacation

I'm ready, vacation

Vacation, vacation.

Hey, Gary.

[ meows]

That's right, Gary,
I amhome early.

I'm on vacation!

Well, good night, Gary.

Ah, vacation.

[ foghorn blowing loudly]

[ grunting]

[ crunching loudly]

La lala la lalala

Good morning, Krusty crew.

And hello, Squidward.

I thought you were on vacation.

He was, and is!

I told you to take
a vacation, boy!

What's a vacation?

Well, a vacation is when
you don't come in to work.

[ shrieks]:
No work!

What will I do all day?

Oh, I don't know
just go, have fun

or whatever,
I really don't care.

You just can't be here.

But who will fry the patties and
clean the grill while I'm gone?

Squidward can't
do it all alone!

Nor will I.

That's why I've hired

an unpaid intern
as your temporary replacement.

PATRICK
Good morning, boss.

I'm ready for my first day.

Speaking of starfish,

here's your
replacement
right here.

Replacement?Hi, SpongeBob.

That's enough banter
on my dime!

Okay, boss.

Wait a second, Patrick.

You'll need the right
tools for the job.

Wow.

Huh! They put a tiny me

in this bellyscratcher!

Ahh.

[ moaning]

Wow! It scratches backs, too!

I'll take it
from here, SpongeBob,

Just go on home.

Enjoy your vacation.

I really should
show Patrick

the proper patty
flipping technique.

[ meows]

I'm on vacation, Gary.

I'm not allowed
to go to work.

[ tummy growling]

My stomach has receded.

Mr. Krab said I couldn't
work at the Krusty Krab.

He didn't say I
couldn't eat there.

This is my ticket
back inside.

Go away, SpongeBob.

You're ruining my
vacationfrom you.

I'm not here
to see you, Squidward.

SpongeBob, do we have
to go through this again?

I'm here as a customer,
not an employee.

Just going to grab a Krabby
Patty with Patrick for lunch.

All right, but lunch only.

If you so much
as touch a spatula,

you'll be vacationing
in Davy Jones's locker!

You have my word, sir.

No working.

Hey, Pat, it's time
for your lunch...

Ow! Ow! Ow!

Patrick!

You can't do that!

Huh?

You need to turn up the grill

to exactly 298 degrees
Fahrenheit .

Patrick, this is
no way to treat

a Krabby Patty.

SpongeBob!

What did I tell you

about working?

Wait! It's not
what you think.

Out you go, boy.

But my knowledge
could help Patrick

maintain the high standard
of the Krusty Krab!

We've got it all
under control here.

I don't want to see
hide nor tail of you

until your vacation is over,
you got that?

Yes, Mr. Krabs.

Well, boy, off you go!

Don't come back until it's over!

Oh, what to do? What to do?

I know just the thing
to get the spirits up.

The official Krusty Krab
play set.

[ mimicking Squidward]:
SpongeBob, I need

20 Krabby Patties
on the double, please.

Sure thing,
Mr. Squidward, sir.

20 Krabby Patties
coming up.

SpongeBob!
What are you doing here?!

You're going
to cost me some loot

if you don't get
your square keister home!

Out, out, out!

Until your vacation is over!

Oh, what to do
on this boring vacation?

Hey! I know just the thing
to get the old spirits up.

[ as Squidward]:
I need 20 Krabby Patties,
please.

Sure thing, old
buddy, old squid,

20 Krabby Patties coming...

[ meowing]

You're right, Gary.

It is unhealthy to think
about the Krusty Krab

while I'm on vacation.

I need to get out of the house.

Uh, Mr. Krabs,
he's out there again.

I'll deal with this.

Boy, you're
on Krusty Krab property!

Back it up!

Further.

Further...

Further!

Further...
Further. Further.

Further.

Further!

Further.

That'll do.

Mr. Krabs is right.

In order to enjoy my vacation,
I need to stay away from work,

physically andmentally.

[ buzzing]

Hey, that reminds me of...

[ sizzling]

Yeah.

Hold it right there,
Mr. WorkaholicPants.

You're on vacation.

You need to just sit
down and relax.

That's more like it.

Just sit back
and watch the clouds.

That one's a jellyfish.

That's a pirate ship.

And that's a lowsalt ketchup.

Whoa, lowsalt ketchup?!

[ crashing]

[ backup signal beeping]

Got your steaming
hot bun delivery here.

[ backup signal beeping]

Eh? What is the big idea here?

[ stuttering ]

[ ringing]

[ mumbling]:
Hello?

Hello?

Hello.

Yeah?

Hello.

Hello!

Hmm. I didn't even
know I had an ear.

Huh?

Hey! I just cleaned that one.

Patrick, shh!

It talks! Ahh!

Oh... Somebody help!

I'm stuck!

Mr. Krabs.

Oh, thank Neptune,
it's you.

I'm in a bit
of a fix here.

Uh, Mr. Krabs.

[ flushing]

[ yelling]:
No!

[ munching 
and slurping]

Uhoh.

Now what?

Tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk.

Had enough for one day, son.

[ engine revving, 
tires squealing]

Thanks for the ride home,
Mr. Krabs.

Not a problem
at all, me boy.

Just take the next right.

Mr. Krabs,
we just passed the turnoff.

Uhhuh.

My house is back
that way, Mr. K.

Far out,
little man.

Far out.

Where did you say
you were taking me?

Look, boy
I brought your spatula!

[ panting]

Come on, boy,come on.

Now get it, boy.

Get it. Get the spatula.

Go get it!

[ panting]

[ barking]

[ tires squealing]

Enjoy your vacation, boy!

It's not fair.

Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard
to get rid of me?

I'm only on vacation.

Unless...

it's a...

[ gasping]:
permanent vacation.

That's it!

Mr. Krabs wants to replace me.

Oh, I should have known.

Patrick's had his eye
on myjob all along!

He's been scheming.

They think I'm outdated.

They think I'm all washed up.

Well, I'll show them.

Working at the Krusty Krab

Flipping Krabby
Patties all day

Flipping Krusty Krab

Patties Krab...

That's a hard song to remember.

[ dings]

Huh?

Who do they think they are?

I've given the best years
of my life to this place,

and they think they can just
fire me like that, like trash?

I don't think so.SpongeBob?

[ grumbling]

Is that you?

I've been waiting for you,
Patrick.

[ whimpering]

[ growling]

SpongeBob, you're scaring me!

[ screaming]

[ laughing maniacally]

SQUIDWARD:
What'll it be?

One Krabby Patty, please.

One shell on a shingle.

Well, I'll be.

Patrick, you're cooking's
improved onethousandfold.

Congratulations, boy.

You finally got
the hang of it.

[ gasps]

[ laughing evilly]

SpongeBob?

No wonder!

Patrick could never flip
that many patties in an hour.

What happened
to that feller anyway?

Oh, I told him to stay home
and watch television.

[ laughing]

[ static]

Why'd you do it, laddy?

[ weepy]:
Oh, Mr. Krabs.

I love the putrid grease
of the Krusty Krab so much!

[ sobbing]

I just couldn't stay away.

You don't have to.

Your accumulated vacation time
is used up.

The union can't fine me anymore.

You must have saved a fortune.

Bumping Barnacle, yes.

And there she is.

Wow, that's more than
I make in a year.

Don't be asking me
for a raise.

Just get back to work!

Yippee!

I happily acquiesce.

Man, this is going to be
our most rocking tour ever!

Yeah!

Hey, dudes, check out the debut
of my new look.

[ all laughing]

Whoa! What's that
on your head?

Yeah, is that a wig
or a pile of toilet paper?

Come on, guys,
give it a chance.

Let me try it on.

Hey! You've revealed
my shiny dome.

Hot potato!Catch!

Give it back, man.

If you want it, you
got to catch it, dude.

Oops!

Oh, man!
My beautiful wig!

I'm ready!

I'm read...

What is this?

Curly tresses? Poofy texture?
Itchy scalp?

It's a wig!

Hi, Patrick.

How do you like
my new look?

I'll save you!

I'm saving you
from that braineating alien

that's attacking your head!

Patrick, the only thing
attacking me is you!

Oh. Sorry.

It's okay.

Why did you do that?

[ belches ]

I thought it was a new type

of cotton candy
you wear on your head.

Well, it's not,
but that is an
excellent idea.

Then what is it?!

It's my new look.

I'm wearing a wig.

A wig?

[ laughing hysterically]

Oh... Oh, I can't... Oh...

Oh, I can't stand... Oh...

[ breathing heavily]

Oh... Oh, boy.

Don't you think
that's a little silly?

[ alarm clock ringing]

Oh, man! It's time for
my weekly condiment soak.

Do you mind?

Nice wig.

Thanks.
I am very fashionable today.

Hey, Square Fashion.

Nice couture.

Why, thank you.

So, that, huh?

Nice 'do, SpongeBob.

Yeah. Where can I get one?

[ both laughing]

Wow!

That wig
really suits you.

[ alllaughing ]

[ snoring]

Hi, Squidward!

What? What? What
What? What? How?

Notice anything different
about me today, Squidward?

Huh? Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

Huh?

Nope.

I'm wearing a wig.

Oh, yeah. How could
I have missed it?

Can you believe I found it
lying around in the street?

Amazing.

If you want to, after work, we
could go look for a wig for you!

I can't wait.

Wig away!

Whoohoo!

Order up, Squidward!

Mr. Krabs!

I've served a lot
of junk here,

but a hair patty?

Hmm.

SpongeBob!

Yes, Mr. Krabs?

What in Davy Jones' locker
is on your head, son?

Oh, that's my new wig,
Mr. Krabs.

Well, take it off!

The hair's getting
into the patties!

Take it off?

But I can't, Mr. Krabs.

My wig makes everyone so happy.

Happy?Ever since I began wearing it,

everyone I see
gets a big grin on their face.

I can imagine.

Oh, please let me
keep it, Mr. Krabs.

Well, if it means that much
to you, you can keep it.

But you've got
to wear a hairnet.

And, if I see one more
hairy patty, your wig goes

in the Dumpster.

There you are, SpongeBob.

Are you ready
for karate practice?

I see you've
noticed my new wig.

Pretty impressive, huh?

It's great, SpongeBob.

[ laughing]

Glad you like it.

I'll see you
later, Sandy.

Two Krabby Patties and a side
order of lookin' good.

Nice wig.

Like to keep
in style, huh?

You know it.

Off to meet the queen,
Sir Nerd Leroy?

The name is SpongeBob,

and no,
I am not meeting royalty.

You must be referring
to my regal appearance.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

[ all laughing]

Thank you all
for your kind words.

I wish I could give
you such nice wigs.

How about a little
off the top?

Yeah, your wig's big
enough to go around.

This isn't good.

Everyone's getting jealous.

Squidward,
I'll be hiding

in the kitchen
if you need me.

Hide your shame,
SpongeBob.

Hide your shame.

RECORD PRODUCER: 
Well, well, well.

Ned and the Needlefish.

You're fired.
ALL:
Fired?!

But why?

Ask Baldy McBaldyson over here.

ALL:
Ned!

Good going, dude.

I can't help not having hair!

We formed this band
it was for one reason

and one reason only.

To make a lot of money.

And you not
having hair

is getting in
the way of that!

We are selling records,
not denture cream.

Either you come
back with hair,

or don't come
back at all!

MR. KRABS:
Time to go home, boys!

Almost finished!

See, Squidward?

It's functional, too.

It's about as functional
as your brain.

Haha, haha; thank
you, Squidward.

That wasn't a compliment!

The entire town
is laughing at you!

I don't understand.

Just look
at yourself!

Hello, handsome.

[ sizzles]

SpongeBob,
your head is

twice as large
as before.

I've never been
tall before.

That wig is infested
with parasites!

[ giggling]

That tickles!

Can't you see how
ridiculous you look?

Ithink that
it looks cool.

[ laughing]

You wouldn't know cool

if I locked you
in the freezer.

For your information,
Mr. Krabs,

Squidward haslocked me
in the freezer,

so I think I know
what cool is.

You stop wearing
that nasty thing to work.

But, Mr. Krabs...

No "buts."

So I can't have
a wig or a butt?

No, SpongeBob.

It means, until you
get rid of that wig,

get your butt out of here!

I never got a chance to talk
to SpongeBob yesterday.

I was laughing too hard.

SpongeBob?

Huh?

Hi, Sandy.
What do you think?

We need to talk.

SPONGEBOB:
Why would I want
to get rid of my wig?

Look how happy it
makes everybody.
[ laughing]

Well, it does attract
a lot of attention.

I know! People just can't keep
their eyes off of me.

Neither can I, SpongeBob.

It's true, Tom, this
isn't my real hair.

I stole it.

Pardon me. Excuse me.

Pardon me. Pardon me.

Whoa!

Ugh! Ugh!

Hey, the wig broke my fall.

Mm, popcorn.

[ loud chomping]

[ slurping]

Ah, you always come through
for me.

Hey, buddy, do you mind?

Shh!

It's very rude to talk

during a movie.
[ growling ]

Um, SpongeBob?

You too, Sandy.

People are trying
to watch the movie.

Well, they can't.

Look, your stupid wig

is blocking the
whole screen.

Take it off, jerk!

Hey! Down in front!Take the wig off!

People, return your attention
to the movie!

I know my wig is
glamorous and exciting,

but there is no need
to start a riot.

That's a great idea.

Let's start a riot!

Ahh!

Get him!
Get him!

I told you that
movie was terrible.

Now do you see what
I'm saying, SpongeBob?

I guess you're right,
Sandy.

I got so much enjoyment
out of the wig myself,

I assumed everyone
else did, too.

It's time to be strong.

I know.

I just want you to know that...

[ sniffling]:
even though I didn't know

you existed a few days ago,

I can't imagine
life without you.

Hurry up, SpongeBob.

No matter what they say,

you'll always be cool to me.

I'll never
accessorize again.

You did the right thing,
SpongeBob.

Where am I going
to get some hair?

My career is ruined.

Ruined!

[ sobbing]

[ gasps]

Can it be?

It is! My wig!

Yes! Victory is mine!

Wigs!

Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.

Oh, he's got your hair.

Thank you.

SpongeBob!

Patrick!

At least he's not wearing a wig.

Look at my new wig.

Everyone's wearing wigs!

Everyone!

I'm starting to feel
a little betrayed.

Hey, you made fun
of me yesterday.

I thought powdered wigs
were uncool.

Yeah, they were.

But look.

Wow, Ned and the Needlefish

wearing my wig.

So I was cool
before anyone else?

Yes, you were.

But not anymore.

See ya!

I wish Ihad a wig.

Don't be sad, SpongeBob.

You can borrow one of mine.

Just wash it
before you return it.

A submarine?

This whole lab is called

I'll shrink the sub and myself

...then navigate
through your brain,

down into your throat,
and extract the reed

from inside. Simple!

Why don't you just
shrink the reed?

SQUIDWARD:

All you need to do
is locate the autopilot.

It'll safely take you

the extraction point.

Natural gas?

Stop burping inside me!

That's disgusting!

Wait a minute, Squidward.

They might be

What?
If you could make
a big enough burp...

We could filter the C02
through our ballast tanks,

refire the engines,

and ride the shock wave
out of here!

Wow.

He's right.What?

We're going through
with your plan, Patrick.

Yay!
What plan?

Now burp, Squidward.

Lives are on the line.

I got to get
out of town!

Oh, thanks, SpongeBob.

Sure, Patrick...

[ screaming]:
I got to get going!

He told me to.Who did?

Uh... well...

Uh... hmm...

I'm not sure,
but he had a briefcase.

[ screaming]:
Oh, a briefcase!

He might be a
paid assassin.

[ both screaming]

But, Patrick, you can't
gonot like this.

Who will go with me to the next
Jellyfisherman's Expo?

It will have to be one
of your other chums.

'Cause my mind is set.

[ both sobbing]

Unset it,
please unset it.

[ loud sobbing]

I guess I'll pack up my stuff
and get ready to go.

My... clothes.

Um, Patrick,
those are my clothes.

My peanut butter.

That's my peanut butter.

And my pickles.

I can't believe
you're leaving, Patrick...

with all my pickles!

It's the end of me...

being here.

Wait!

Stop.

What about all
our plans?

"8:00 a.m.,
wake up Patrick.

"9:00 a.m.,
eat Kelpo with Patrick.

"10:00 a.m.,
brush teeth with Patrick.

1:00 p.m., stare at Patrick."

Who's going to do
all that with me?

I'm sorry, there's no
stopping the unstoppable.

Patrick Star will live no more,
forever...

in Bikini Bottom.

But what if you
weren't Patrick Star?

Oh, no!
I'm not Patrick Star?

You are Patrick Star,
but you won't be for long.

Huh?

There you go, Patrick.

No one will
know it's you.
[ screaming]

[ gasps]:
Patrick, you okay?

Hey, guys.

Yo, Patrick,
cool shades.

Well, Pat,
that disguise didn't work.

We're going to have
to try harder.

Yeah, well, thanks,
old SpongeBob, for your help.

It was a noble
effort,

but alas, all in vain.

It's no use.
I must leave.

Oh...

Goodbye, rock.

Goodbye, coral... Ow!

Goodbye, seaweed.

Too bad we couldn't come up
with a better costume.

Hmm...

Goodbye, sky.

That's it!

With that seaweed
on your head, you could be...

I know! I know!

I could be
Mr. Seaweed Monster Man.

And live happily
forever after in Bikini Bottom.

Patrick, there already
is a Mr. Seaweed Monster Man.

Hey.

Darn.

It's okay, Patrick.

So you can't be
a monster.

But that vegetation
on your head

give me an idea
of what you can be.

You're all set.

Come on out, Patrick.

Hi, SpongeBob.

And hello, lady!

The disguise is
working, Patrick.

I mean... Patricia.

[ both giggling]

SpongeBob,

you never told me
you had a girlfriend.

Oh, I'm not
his girlfriend.

I'm Pat.
...tricia.

Patricia,
Patricia.

[ nervous laugh]

Bro, your girlfriend
is not ugly.

Actually, Larry,
she's not my girlfriend.

She's just a...

It's cool, buddy.

You don't have to explain
your girlfriend to me.

But she's not
my girlfriend.

I don't know why you're
standing here talking to me

when you could be talking
to your girlfriend.

Come on, Patricia.

Bye.

Congratulations on
the new girlfriend, dude.

SpongeBob, this is not
the time for a Sunday stroll.

It's time for work.

But, Mr. Krabs,
the Krusty Krab doesn't open

for another two hours.

There'll be
no such thing

as opening too
early, me boy.

Excuse us, Miss.

Huh?

SpongeBob,
who's your friend?

Mr. Krabs,
this is Patricia.

Patricia.

The most beautiful sound
I've ever seen.

SpongeBob, do we need any more
help down at The Krusty Krab?

No.We do? Great.
She can start right away.

[ door opening]

Huh...

And who are you,
my Rubenesque beauty?

That's Patricia

our newest Krusty Krab
employee.

Well, she sure is stunning.

Just keep your eyes

on the customers,
Mr. Squidward.

Hi, Patricia.

I drew this for you.

The likeness is uncanny
if I do say so myself.

[ distant screaming]

Uh, thank you, Squidward.

[ door opening]

Order up, Miss Patricia.

Excuse me, Squidward.

[ belches]

This order goes
to table seven.

And remember
your manners.

Four... nee... foonee...

KRABS:
That's a seven, Patricia.

Mr. Krabs, you ordered
two Krusty Meals?

[ gasps]:
Did I order two meals?

Oh, silly me.

I can't possibly eat two
Krusty Meals myself.

I guess you'll just have
to help me

finish all
this food.

Okay.

[ romantic music playing]

Patricia,
we may have only

known each other
for a short time now,

but I feel like a special
connection has been made.

[ noisy chewing]

[ music slows]

[ loud belch]

Quite an appetite,
but she's all woman.

[ clarinet playing]

Eh?

You know, Patricia,
they don't call me

the sizzlelipped
squid for nothing.

So are you free
this Saturday night?

No. That's the night
SpongeBob and I

are having
a staring contest.

SpongeBob?!

Get back to work, you
goldbricking freeloader!

Hut two, hut,
two, ya, ya!

And don't come back until
all those patties are Krabby.

Well, now that we're alone,

how would you like to be
my date Friday night to a...

I can't.

SpongeBob and I will be
flying submarines that night.

I have to get back
to Krusting the Krab.

Man, why are those two
so nice to me?

They were never this nice
to Patrick.

It's weird.

Are you sure
about Saturday night?

[ loud crash]

Persistent bunch.

How about
Sunday brunch?

No thanks... again.

But I made reservations
for two at...

I said no.

No.

No way.

No.

No.

No!

What is itabout me

that makes those two
so friendly?

Must have something
to do with this disguise.

I can't wear this
any longer.

If you reveal
your secret identity,

you'll have to leave
Bikini Bottom.

I'm sorry, SpongeBob.

I just can't live
like this anymore.

I'm tired of pretending
to be someone I'm not.

[ all talking at once]

The lovely Patricia...
[ smooches]

has returned to us.

I have an announcement
to make.

The entire day
that I've worked here,

I've wanted to say...

[ door opens, gasps]

[ silly muttering]

I've wanted to say that, uh...

that...

that I will eat any leftovers
you leave on your plate.

ALL:
Huh?

Ahoy!

Waitress!

Aren't you gonna take 
myorder?

I'll be right there, sir.

What's the
matter, Patrick?

Ththat's the guy
with the briefcase.

The guy who's trying
to run me out of town.

[ gasps]

The assassin!

What can I get you, sir?

Say,

don't I know you
from somewhere?

No.

Hmm.

[ gasps]:
That's it!

Get outta town!

He's on to us.

I won't let you do it.

You'll have to do
something horrible to me

before I'll let you
throw Patrick out of town!

Patrick?!
Patrick?!

You forgot your flyer.

SPONGEBOB:
"Get outta town!

To beautiful Sunny
Shore Resorts."

Look, this guy wasn't trying
to run you out of town.

He just wanted
to sell you a luxury vacation

at a modest price.

Well, I guess I don't need
this disguise anymore.

[ all gasping]

Um...

I think I need to take a shower.

So, let me get this straight.

Uh, you're not a woman?

No.

Well, then you're fired.

Uh, if anybody needs me,
I'll be in my office

for, I don't know,
the next 20 years or so.

Hey, buddy, what do
you say we go home

and get started
on this list?

[LAUGHING]

[♪...]

Squidward: IT'S TOO QUIET.

SOMETHING ISN'T
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

COULD IT BE?

SPONGEBOB IS GONE
FOR THE EVENING.

HERE'S TO A DELIGHTFUL EVENING
ALONE WITH YOU,
PUBLIC TELEVISION.

[INSTRUMENTS TUNING UP]

[PIERCING LAUGHTER]

[GROANING]

Patrick: DO IT AGAIN,
DO IT AGAIN.

Spongebob: O.K.

[LAUGHING]

[LAUGHING]

WILL YOU TWO BE QUIET?

I'M TRYING TO WATCH
PUBLIC TELEVISION.

[LAUGHING] DO IT AGAIN,
DO IT AGAIN.

IF THOSE TWO WANT TO RUIN
MY QUIET EVENING AT HOME,
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT.

[♪...]

[KNOCKING]

[GROANING]

WHAT?

SQUIDWARD!

[SIGHING]

YOU'RE STILL THERE, AREN'T YOU?

GOOD EVENING, SQUIDWARD.

NOT SO FAST.

YOU TWO LITTLE MONSTERS AREN'T
ABOUT TO RUIN MY EVENING.

OH, WE'RE NOT HERE TO RUIN IT.

WE'RE HERE TO ENHANCE IT.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PAT?

YEAH, WE'RE HERE...

CAN'T A HARDWORKING SQUID GET
A LITTLE TV TIME ALONE?

[SIGHING]

SPONGEBOB?

PATRICK?

OH, WHAT'S THE POINT.

[♪...]

COULD YOU TURN IT UP?

UH, SQUIDWARD?

COULD YOU TURN IT DOWN A LITTLE?

SQUIDWARD, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

SQUIDWARD, HOW COME
HE'S SO EMOTIONAL?

IS HE THE BAD GUY?

[GROANING...]

SQUIDWARD?

SQUIDWARD?

SQUIDWARD?

SQUIDWARD?

[SCREAMING]

THAT'S IT.

ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS WATCH SOME SMOOTH JAZZ
ON PUBLIC TELEVISION.

BUT APPARENTLY,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

ONCE AGAIN, I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO LEAVE MY OWN HOME JUST
TO GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET.

[GRUNTING] ENJOY MY TV.

PFAH.

OH, WAIT, I THINK
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

THIS PART'S FUNNY.

Squidward: I'M GONNA GO
SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY.

SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY
FROM THOSE TWO.

WATCHING PUBLIC TELEVISION
ON MY TV.

PFAH.

THEY WOULDN'T KNOW REAL CULTURE
EVEN IF IT HIT THEM LIKE
A TRUCK FULL OF CEMENT.

[GROANING]

UGH.

[GURGLING]

[SCREAMING...]

[GURGLING]

[SCREAMING]

DAY FIVE, I THINK.

I'VE BEEN WADDLING THESE FIELDS.

I'M HUNGRY, TIRED, AND LOST.

THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT
THIS IS, NO SPONGEBOB.

JELLYFISH FIELDS.

MM...

[LAUGHING]

WHAT IS THAT THING, PATRICK?

I DON'T KNOW.

LET'S GET A CLOSER LOOK.

[GRUNTING]

HI, STRANGER.

I AM SPONGEBOB.

[GRUNTING]

[SCREAMING]

[GROANING...]

WAIT A MINUTE.

MAYBE HE'S NOT A MONSTER.

MAYBE HE'S
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.

[GRUNTING]

WE SHOULD HELP HIM.

[LAUGHING] YEAH, HELP HIM.

GO AWAY.

CAN'T YOU TELL NOBODY WANTS YOU?

YOU'RE ENDANGERED.

NOT LIKE THAT.

WITH LOTS OF LOVE AND AFFECTION,
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF HIM.

[GROANING]

SpongeBob: WELL, SMELLY,
HERE YOU ARE.

YOUR NEW HOME.

OH, SMELLY,
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

WE'LL BE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

HERE'S YOUR BED, SMELLY.

[GROANING]

HERE'S YOUR FOOD BOWL.

AND SOME KIBBLE.

YOU CAN LIVE HERE
FOREVER AND EVER.

[SOBBING]

OH, LOOK, PAT.

HE'S CRYING TEARS OF JOY.

WELL, SMELLY,
THERE'S ONE MORE FAMILY MEMBER
YOU HAVEN'T MET.

SMELLY, MEET GARY.

OH, LOOK AT THAT, SMELLY.

GARY LIKES YOU.

[MEOWING...]

GARY, NO.

[MEOWING]

GARY.

I DON'T THINK GARY LIKES SMELLY.

YEAH, GARY'S NEVER ATTACKED
ANYONE LIKE THAT,
EXCEPT SQUIDWARD.

I GUESS SMELLY CAN'T LIVE HERE.

AH, HE CAN COME LIVE WITH ME.

THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, PATRICK.

YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED A PET.

[GROANING]

ISN'T THAT CUTE?

LOOK HOW EXCITED HE IS
TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE.

SpongeBob: BYE, SMELLY.

HAVE FUN AT PATRICK'S.

[GROANING]

NO, NO, SMELLY.

SQUIDWARD DOESN'T LIKE PETS.

HEY, SMELLY, WANNA PLAY CATCH?

[GROANING]

DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GET
THE HANG OF IT.

[GROANING]

ALMOST.

AGAIN.

[GROANING]

SO CLOSE.

YEAH, NOW YOU'RE... [GROANING].

[SCREAMING]

SMELLY!

WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

HELLO, ANIMAL CONTROL.

THERE'S A WILD ANIMAL
LOOSE IN MY HOUSE.

[VOICE ON PHONE]

SURE, I'LL HOLD.

[♪...]

[GROANING]

SMELLY, COME BACK!

SMELLY!

Man: FREEZE.

OH, WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION.

[SIRENS WAILING]

Man: YOU ARE SURROUNDED.

THERE IS NO WAY OUT.

SMELLY.

SpongeBob: EXCUSE ME.

PARDON ME.

IF I CAN JUST SCOOCH
THROUGH THERE.

EXCUSE ME.

PARDON ME.

EXCUSE ME.

YOU LEAVE SMELLY ALONE.

HE'S JUST A POOR, DUMB,
WILD ANIMAL.

WILD ANIMALS DON'T
BELONG HERE, SON.

THEY BELONG IN THE ZOO.

GET HIM, BOYS.

[GRUNTING]

[GROWLING]

[SCREAMING]

SMELLY!

MOMMY, WHAT IS THAT THING?

I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S HIDEOUS, ISN'T IT?

[LAUGHTER]

THIS ISN'T GOOD.

YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

IT NEEDS MUSTARD.

NO ONE SHOULD
BE TREATED LIKE THAT.

NOT EVEN SOMEONE
AS UGLY AS SMELLY.

SOMETHING NEEDS TO
BE DONE ABOUT THIS,
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT THING IS.

[WHISPERING]

O.K., PATRICK.

REMEMBER THE PLAN?

UH, YEAH.

THIS ONE, RIGHT?

NO, NOT THAT.

I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN
TO BREAK SMELLY OUT OF
THIS ANIMAL PRISON.

MM, GOOD PLAN.

ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO DOWN FIRST.

KEEP A LOOKOUT AND FOLLOW ME.

YOU'RE MY HERO.

[MOANING]

HEY, SPONGEBOB.

HELP!

[SCREAMING]

SHH, WE'LL GET CAUGHT.

[SCREAMING]

WHAT, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

I'M SCREAMING TOO LOUD.

[SCREAMING]

[GRUNTING]

FEAR NO LONGER, DEAR SMELLY.

WE ARE HERE TO RESCUE YOU.

UNDERSTAND?

WE ARE TAKING YOU HOME.

[GROANING]

LOOK HOW EXCITED HE IS.

FLIP THE SWITCH, PATRICK.

SMELLY, YOU'RE FREE.

YOU'RE SURROUNDED.

THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO RUN.

RUN, PATRICK, RUN!

[SIRENS WAILING]

[ALL MUTTERING]

FASTER, PATRICK.

[ALL MUTTERING]

I'LL LET SMELLY GO FIRST.

[GRUNTING]

DON'T WORRY, SMELLY.

YOU'RE SAFE WITH US.

THINK WE LOST 'EM.

WELL, WE'RE ALL
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY AGAIN.

LET'S SEE WHERE
THIS DARK SEWER TUNNEL LEADS.

TRALALA, LALALALA,
LALALALALALA.

[GROANING]

OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, SMELLY.

SOON WE'LL BE HOME,
AND YOU CAN SLEEP IN
THAT COZY LITTLE PET CARRIER
YOU LOVE SO MUCH.

[SOBBING]

HEY, I SEE LIGHT.

YOU'RE RIGHT, PATRICK,
THAT MUST BE THE WAY OUT.

WHOA, WHERE ARE WE?

LET'S GO ASK THOSE GUYS.

UM, EXCUSE US?

[GRUNTING]

HEY, THEY LOOK JUST LIKE YOU.

GO, BE WITH YOUR REAL FAMILY.

GO AHEAD, SMELLY.

[SCREAMING]

I KNOW YOU'VE COME
TO THINK OF US AS A FAMILY,
BUT IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

[GRUNTING...]

I'M GONNA MISS HIM, SPONGEBOB.

ME TOO, BUDDY.

ME TOO.

BUT HE'S WITH HIS OWN KIND NOW,
WHERE HE BELONGS.

AND ON THAT NOTE, LET US GO BACK
TO WHERE WE BELONG.

[GRUNTING...]

[♪...]

AH, SALUTATIONS, MY CHILDREN.

ARE YOU READY FOR
YOUR DAILY DOSE OF SMOOTH JAZZ?

[GRUNTING AND APPLAUSE]

[CRACKING]

[LAUGHING]

UM, HI.

COME ON, "STOVEY,"
POP THAT CORN.

GET READY, GARY.

[PANTING]

INCOMING!

[MEOWING]

POPCORN IS SERVED.

[♪...]

THAT BRO IS TROUBLE
AT ANY CAR WASH.

Man: WE WILL RETURN
TO BIKINI BOTTOM CAR WASH
AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

ARE YOU BORING?

YES, YES I AM.

Man: WHEN FRIENDS DESCRIBE YOU,
DO THEY USE WORDS
LIKE "DULL," OR "DRAB?"

HA, HA, HA,
DON'T FORGET "PLATITUDINOUS."

YES, THAT TOO, CHARLIE.

BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU COULD CHANGE ALL THAT,
WITH THE MAGIC OF... MAGIC.

[LAUGHING]

I LOOK LIKE
SOME KIND OF MAGICIAN.

NOW PEOPLE WON'T IGNORE ME.

LET'S HOPE NOT, CHARLIE.

WITH MY MR. MAGIC
MAGICAL MAGIC KIT,

EVEN YOU CAN IMPRESS
AND AMAZE YOUR FRIENDS.

I WANT TO IMPRESS
AND AMAZE MY FRIENDS.

Mr. Magic: JUST SEND $19.95
TO ME, MR. MAGIC.

[PANTING]

[GRUNTING...]

Man: FOUR TO SIX WEEKS LATER.

ONE MAGIC KIT, AND ANOTHER ONE
OF THESE YELLOW THINGS.

HERE IT IS.

MR. MAGIC'S MAGICAL MAGIC KIT.

[GASPING]

LOOK AT ALL THIS.

A BOOK OF SPELLS,
MY VERY OWN WAND OF WHIMSY...

THE BEARD OF RASPUTIN.

AND OF COURSE,
THE ALLIMPORTANT LICENSE

[SIGHING]

SQUIDWARD.

HE'LL APPRECIATE
MY NEWLYDELIVERED SKILL.

BRINE SODA,
LOWFAT SEAWEED CRISPS,
COOL JAZZ...

MMMMMM, SQUIDWARD,
YOU HAVE DONE IT.

YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY SPOILED
YOURSELF ROTTEN.

Spongebob: WELL, LET
THE ROTTING CONTINUE, FRIEND,
WHILE I IMPRESS AND AMAZE YOU
WITH... MAGIC.

MAGIC?

CAN YOU MAKE YOURSELF
DISAPPEAR, SPONGEBOB?

[LAUGHING]

SILLY SQUIDWARD.

I WON'T LEARN VANISHING SPELLS
UNTIL I BECOME
A LEVEL 10 WIZARD.

NO, I'D BETTER START
WITH SOMETHING SIMPLER.

SAY, CARD CONJURING.

HERE, HOLD
THIS SIMPLE PLAYING CARD,

WHILE I TRANSFORM IT INTO
A MAGIC PLAYING CARD
BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES.

LET'S SEE.

[SIGHING]

STEP ONE.

[EXHALING]

THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY END SOON.

WHICH BRINGS US TO...
STEP THREE.

JUGGLE SOMETHING.

WELL, IF YOU INSIST, MR. MAGIC.

I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
JUST TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE.

THEN, TAKE ONE CARD
AND SHOVE IT IN YOUR EAR.

[CRYING]

BUT I DON'T LIKE PISTACHIO.

THEN WHY DID YOU ASK FOR IT?

[CRYING]

[GROANING]

AND FINALLY, JUST SAY
THE WORDS "HOBRISPOBRIS."

SQUIDWARD!

MY SIMPLE CARD TRICK
HAS TURNED YOU INTO
AN ICE CREAM CONE.

WHICH MEANS...

I AM A LEVEL 10 WIZARD!

I SUPPOSE I SHOULD CHANGE YOU

OH, I AM SO SORRY, SQUIDWARD.

I'VE TRANSFORMED YOU INTO
A DELICIOUS DAIRY DESSERT,
AND I CAN'T CHANGE YOU BACK.

THERE, THERE, SQUIDWARD.

THERE IS NO NEED TO CRY.

I PROMISE YOU WILL CONTINUE
YOUR NORMAL LIFE,

DESPITE THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE NOW EDIBLE.

[♪...]

[SCREAMING]

[SCREAMING]

SQUIDWARD, SPEAK TO ME.

SPEAK...

[GRUNTING]

[PANTING]

HEY, SQUID.

ARE YOU O.K.?

HEY, SQUID.

OH, AREN'T THEY CUTE?

I PROMISE TO STAND BY

OVER MY BUDDY.

HEY, SPONGEBOB.

WHAT YOU DOING?

I HAVE TURNED POOR SQUIDWARD
INTO A FROZEN DESSERT.

THAT'S AWFUL.

HOW TRAGIC.

POOR SQUIDWARD.

IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

DID YOU SAY FROZEN DESSERT?

YEAH, I TURNED HIM INTO
A TASTY SOFT SERVE
WITH A WAFFLE CONE.

[SOBBING]

OOH, SOFT SERVE.

PATRICK!

STOP EATING SQUIDWARD!

OH.

SORRY.

PATRICK!

[SCREAMING]

BUT HE'S SO TASTY.

[SCREAMING]

LOOK, PATRICK,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

THIS ISN'T JUST
YOUR ORDINARY ICE CREAM CONE.

IT'S PISTACHIO.

NO, IT'S SQUIDWARD.

AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
I PROMISED HIM THAT
I WOULD WATCH OVER HIM,

TO ENSURE HIS SOFT FROZEN LIFE
IS UNCHANGED.

[SCREAMING]

PATRICK!

SQUIDWARD HAS MELTED!

QUICK, CALL THE POLICE.

WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

OH, NEPTUNE,
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

WHAT HAVE I DONE?

WHAT HAVE I DONE?

CURSE YOU!

HEY!

THAT'S IT.

THERE'S THE ANSWER
TO OUR PROBLEMS.

"WARNING.

FROM AGES NINE TO 99."

NO, PATRICK.

THE ONE MYSTIC BEING
THAT CAN HELP US.

MR. MAGIC.

JUST FOLLOW THE BROWN TILE ROAD
TO THE MOST MYSTERIOUS MYSTIC
OF 'EM ALL.

NO ONE'S EVER SEEN HIM
IN PERSON.

Mr. Magic: ENTER.

WHO DARES TO SEE MR. MAGIC?

[SCREAMING]

SPEAK UP.

IT IS I,
SPONGEBOB OF THE SQUAREPANTS,
MAGICIAN LEVEL ONE.

INTO ICE CREAM.

GOOD JOB.

WELL, THANK YOU, BUT...
WELL, I CAN'T CHANGE HIM BACK.

HMM, UM, WELL, HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT OF A DIFFERENT HOBBY?

I NEED YOUR HELP
TO CHANGE HIM BACK.

MY HELP?

UH, NO THANK YOU.

BUT IF YOU DON'T,
MY FRIEND WILL BE
A CONE FOREVER.

SORRY, I, UM, I'M,
OUT TO LUNCH, THAT'S IT.

I'LL WAIT.

I'M ON A TWOYEAR LUNCH.

OH, PLEASE.

Mr. Magic: SILENCE.

BUT SIR, NO ONE ELSE
HAS YOUR POWER OF SORCERY.

THANK YOU.

HEY, SPONGEBOB,
THERE'S A GUY OVER HERE
TALKING INTO A TUBEY THING.

UM, IGNORE YOUR FRIEND.

THE FISH YOU SEE
IS ONLY AN ILLUSION.

HUH?

WHY'S HE SAYING
THE SAME THING
MR. MAGIC'S SAYING?

I DON'T KNOW, PATRICK.

WHO ARE YOU, GOOD SIR?

WELL, UH, UH,
I'M HORACE B. MAGIC.

ARE YOU MR. MAGIC?

[LAUGHING]

TECHNICALLY, YES.

BUT THE ONLY MAGIC AROUND HERE
IS THE MAGIC OF BUSINESS.

DOES THAT MEAN YOU CAN'T
CHANGE MY FRIEND BACK?

OH, I'M AFRAID NOT.

SO SORRY ABOUT THAT, LADDIE.

YOUR REFUND CHECK
IS IN THE MAIL.

I DON'T NEED A REFUND.

I WANT MY FRIEND BACK.

THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY.

YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A FAKE.

JUST A LYING,
CORPORATE BUSINESSMAN,

TAINTING THE PURITY OF MAGIC
WITH YOUR CORRUPT,
COMMERCIAL WAYS.

YOU HAVE RUINED MY FAITH
IN THE MAGICAL ARTS.

[SOBBING]

SECURITY.

[SOBBING]

WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT SQUIDWARD?

WE COULD ALWAYS EAT HIM.

I'M KIND OF HUNGRY.

MR. MAGIC WAS A FAKE.

THE MAGIC WORDS WORKED.

I REALLY AM MAGIC AFTER ALL.

CAN I TURN YOU

HEY, STOP.

GET ME OUT OF HERE.

[GRUMBLING]

HEY, SPONGEBOB?

I'M STILL HUNGRY.

WILL YOU TURN ME INTO

SPECIAL DAY IN BIKINI BOTTOM.

SpongeBob: I'M READY!

I'M READY, I'M READY

PATRICK, DID YOU BRING
MY FLASHCARDS?

RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO PASS
THE TEST IS ON THESE CARDS.

NO, PATRICK!

HEY, LEARNING TASTES GOOD.

PATRICK, I NEEDED THOSE.

OH, FIDDLESTICKS!

YOU'VE TAKEN THAT DRIVING TEST
MORE TIMES THAN ANYONE.

57 TIMES.

WELL THEN,
58 IS YOUR LUCKY NUMBER!

YOU'RE GONNA PASS
THAT DRIVING TEST, SPONGEBOB,

BECAUSE YOU'RE A WINNER.

I'M A WINNER?

WHO'S A WINNER?

I'M A WINNER.

WHO'S A WINNER?

I'M A WINNER.

WHO'S A WINNER?

I'M A WINNER, I'M A WINNER!

Narrator: ONE MINUTE,
THIRTYSEVEN SECONDS LATER...

[CRYING]

HOW'D YOU DO, WINNER?

[CRYING]

LET'S SEE THAT LICENSE.

I DIDN'T GET A LICENSE, PATRICK.

ARE THEY GONNA MAIL IT TO YOU?

NO, PATRICK, I FAILED
THE BOATING TEST.

I GUESS 58 WASN'T
MY LUCKY NUMBER, AFTER ALL.

NO WAY!

58 IS, LIKE,
THE LUCKIEST NUMBER EVER.

THE TEST MUST BE RIGGED.

LET'S JUST GO HOME, PATRICK.

WE'RE NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE UNTIL
I GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS!

I'M TAKIN' THAT TEST MYSELF!

SpongeBob: NO, PATRICK!

I'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR YEARS.

THEY'LL EAT YOU ALIVE.

PLEASE, SPONGEBOB.

I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

NO, PATRICK.

SpongeBob: [SCREAMING]: NO!

GOOD MORNING.

YOU'RE NOT THE JUDGE OF ME!

ACTUALLY, I AM.

LET THE TESTING BEGIN!

I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HIM DO IT.

WHAT KIND OF FRIEND AM I?

Patrick: SPONGEBOB, SPONGEBOB!

I'M HERE FOR YOU, BUDDY.

Patrick: I PASSED MY TEST.

YOU GOT A PERFECT SCORE?

YEAH!

I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS HARD.

PERFECT... SCORE.

COME ON.

I'VE GOTTA GET MY PICTURE TAKEN
FOR MY NEW LICENSE.

STAND BEHIND THE LINE, SIR.

HOW DO I LOOK?

LIKE A WINNER.

READY?

READY!

[APPLAUSE AND MUSIC]

HUH?

CONGRATULATIONS, MR. STAR!

YOU'RE THE ONEMILLIONTH PERSON
TO PASS THE TEST.

DOES THAT MEAN
I GET A FREE KEY CHAIN?

UH, NO.

OH.

YOU GET A BRANDNEW BOATMOBILE!

Fish: THE NEW BASS BLASTER 3000,
THE ULTIMATE BOATING MACHINE.

YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

Fish: WOMEN WILL WANT YOU!

[SIGHING]

Fish: MEN WILL WANT TO BE YOU.

[SIGHING]

Fish: YOU'LL BE THE ENVY
OF YOUR FRIENDS.

[SEETHING]

ISN'T THIS GREAT?

I GOT MY LICENSE AND A NEW BOAT.

I'M... SO... HAPPY... FOR YOU.

[HORN BLASTING " LA CUCARACHA"]

WHOA!

THE HORN WORKS.

WHOO!

THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY EVER,
RIGHT, SPONGEBOB?

RIGHT, PATRICK.

I CAN'T THINK OF ONE THING
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS DAY BETTER.

EXCEPT MAYBE GETTING MY LICENSE.

MAYBE IF YOU APPLY YOURSELF,
YOU COULD BE THE TWOMILLIONTH
PERSON TO GET HIS LICENSE.

TWOMILLIONTH?

THEN YOU COULD GET A FREE BOAT,
JUST LIKE ME.

YEAH, "JUST LIKE YOU."

I TRY TO SERVE AS
AN INSPIRATION TO OTHERS.

CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

WE'VE BEEN DRIVIN' AROUND
YOUR HOUSE FOR HOURS.

Patrick: I KNOW!

IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN WALKING,
ISN'T IT?

THANKS FOR THE RIDE, PATRICK.

NO PROBLEM, BUDDY.

YOU CAN'T HELP
BEING A... PEDESTRIAN.

[SHUDDERING]

[IMITATING PATRICK'S SHUDDERING]

[SNORING]

[ENGINE REVVING]

PATRICK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M TRYING TO
WORK ON MY BOATMOBILE.

NOW, COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING, PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO SLEEP.

UGH.

4:00. [YAWNING]

[DOORBELL RINGING]

WHO COULD BE AT THE DOOR
AT THISOW, WHA, [SCREAMING]

NOW WHAT IS IT, PATRICK?

YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME TODAY.

YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE?

YEAH!

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

YOU GOT A NEW BOAT.

YEAH.

HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWIN' ME?

YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR OWNLIFE.

I JUST NEED
A FEW MINUTES SLEEP.

[HORN BLOWING]

MAOW?

YES, GARY, I SAW HIS NEW BOAT.

SO TIRED.

[HORN HONKING]

HEY, BUDDY, NEED A RIDE TO WORK?

THANKS, PATRICK,
BUT I'D RATHER WALK TO WORK.

BOY, I NEVER REALIZED HOW EMPTY
LIFE IS WITHOUT A LICENSE.

THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

NO PROBLEM, BUDDY.

YOU CAN GIVE MERIDES
ONCE YOU GET YOUR LICENSE.

I MEAN, IFYOU GET YOUR LICENSE.

[GROWLING]

THAT'S IT, I AM THROUGH
DRIVING AROUND WITH PATRICK.

IF I HAVE TO SEE 
ONE MOREBOATMOBILE...

SPONGEBOB, YOU'RE MANNIN'
THE DRIVETHROUGH.

WHEN DID WE GET A DRIVETHROUGH?

I REALIZE
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE
"ON THE GO" THESE DAYS.

THEY DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SIT DOWN AND EAT.

THEY'RE TOO BUSY,
OUT ON THE OPEN ROAD,
LIVIN' THEIR DREAMS.

I USED TO HAVE A DREAM.

YEAH?

I USED TO HAVE A KIDNEY STONE.

EVERYTHING PASSES EVENTUALLY.

NOW, STOP DREAMIN',
AND WORK FOR A LIVIN'.

WELCOME TO THE KRUSTY KRAB,
MAY IOW!

[HORN HONKING " LA CUCARACHA"]

THE HORN STILLWORKS.

HEY, SPONGEBOB.

WHAT'S WITH THE HELMET, PATRICK?

WELL, SINCE I'M NOW
AN EXPERT DRIVER, I HAVE TO
KEEP UP MY IMAGE.

UHHUH.

BOY, DRIVING IS SOEASY.

OH.

DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU LESSONS?

OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

OOH!

SpongeBob: PATRICK!

HI, MOMMY, HI, DADDY.

PATRICK, HOW MANY TIMES
DO WE HAVE TO TELL YOU?

WE'RE SPONGEBOB'S MOM AND DAD,
NOT YOURS.

WHAT?

I'M AN ORPHAN?

OH, BUT GUESS WHAT.

I PASSED MY DRIVER'S TEST.

THAT'S GREAT, PATRICK.

SPONGEBOB FAILED HIS TEST,
SO DON'T MENTION IT.

OH, WE KNOW HOW TO
STAY CLEAR OF THATMINEFIELD.

MOM!

WELL, I'VE GOTTA TAKE
MR. WALKSALOT BACK HOME.

HEH, HE'S ALWAYS
ASKIN' FOR RIDES.

HEY.

EVEN PATRICK HAS A LICENSE.

[SIGHING][SIGHING]

LET'S SEE WHAT THIS BABY CAN DO.

PATRICK, THE SPEED LIMIT
IS 40 MILES PER HOUR.

YEAH, YEAH.

SpongeBob: FORTYANDAHALF
MILES PER HOUR.

THAT'S ALMOST 41 MILES PER HOUR.

HE'S SPEEDING.

PATRICK!

STOP THIS CAR.

WHAT, WHERE, WHO?

OFFICER, IT IS MY CIVIC DUTY
TO REPORT THAT THE DRIVER
OF THIS VEHICLE IS SPEEDING.

WHY DON'T YOU CLOCK HIM
WITH YOUR RADAR GUN?

UM, O.K.

ACTUALLY, HE'S GOING 40 MILES 
UNDERTHE LIMIT.

SO MOVE ALONG BEFORE
I RUN YOUIN, TATTLETALE.

ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANNA RUN HIM IN?

THAT'S A RED LIGHT, PATRICK.

AUGH!

PATRICK!

YOU JUST RAN THREE RED LIGHTS!

SO?

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP.

I THINK THE DRIVING GENIUS
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

DRIVING GENIUS?

WOULD A GENIUS MAKE
AN ILLEGAL UTURN?

THROUGH AN ORPHANAGE?

THEY RAN FOR IT IN TIME.

WHAT ARE YOU SO MAD ABOUT?

I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN THAT LICENSE!

AND THIS SHOULD BE 
MYBOATMOBILE.

HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

IF YOU WERE MY FRIEND,
YOU'D BE HAPPY FOR ME
GETTING MY LICENSE.

IF YOU WERE MY FRIEND,
YOU WOULDN'T RUB YOUR LICENSE
IN MY FACE.

I'M NOT RUBBING MY LICENSE
IN YOUR FACE.

THISIS RUBBING MY LICENSE
IN YOUR FACE.

SpongeBob: [MUFFLED NOISES]

OH, GIVE ME THAT!

I'VE WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE
FOR THIS!

YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS!

[LAUGHING]

HUH, LITTERBUGS.

THISIS WHY I JOINED THE FORCE.

[POLICE SIREN WAILING]IT'S THE POLICE!

PULL IT OVER, LITTERBUG.

LITTERBUG?

NO!

OOH, I GOT ME A RUNNER.

PATRICK, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

I DON'T KNOW!

I DON'T HAVE A LICENSE ANYMORE.

LOOK OUT!

[SCREAMING][SCREAMING]

AUGH!AUGH!

WHOA!WHOA!

[SCREAMING]

[POLICE SIRENS WAILING]

[SCREAMING]

90 DAYS.

AND I HOPE YOU LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON
ABOUT LITTERING.

SO LONG, BUDDY.

DON'T FORGET TO FEED GARY.

SOMETIMES YOU FORGET TO
FEED HIM.

WHAT HAVE I DONE?

PATRICK CAN'T SURVIVE IN PRISON.

HE'S TOO SOFT.

WAIT!

PATRICK'S INNOCENT.

I TORE UP PATRICK'S LICENSE
AND THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW.

I'M THE LITTERBUG.

TAKE ME, INSTEAD.

WELL, CONSIDERIN'
THERE'S NO LEGAL PRECEDENT...

OH, WHAT THE HECK.

90 DAYS!

Narrator: ONE DEBT 
TO SOCIETY LATER...

[BEEPING]

[♪...]

PATRICK!

SPONGEBOB!

I'M GLAD YOU PASSED THE TEST.

I'M GLAD YOU HAVE A LICENSE.

AND TO PROVE IT,
I MADE YOU THIS.

SpongeBob: PALS FOREVER.

LET'S PUT IT
ON YOUR BOATMOBILE, BUDDY.

UH, I DON'T HAVE
A BOATMOBILE ANYMORE.

WHAT?

IT STOPPED WORKIN',
SO I THREW IT AWAY.

THE NEEDLE WAS ON "E."

YEAH, I FIGURED
THAT MUST MEAN "END."

OH, THEN WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THIS?

[DINGING NOISE]

HOW'S THAT?

SpongeBob: YEAH!

READY, BUDDY?

READY, PAL.

[MAKING ENGINE NOISES]

WOO, WOO!

[♪...]

YEAH?

GOOD DAY, SIR.

I AM...

[GASPING]

I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE!

AH, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
SPENDING SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH MY GARGAR.

JASON, I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

GRANDPA?

SPONGEBOB, HELP!

HE'S ON TO ME.

I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME!

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

PATRICK, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

OH, I HAVE TO
GET RID OF THESE BOOKS!

WHY?

I'LL SHOW YOU WHY.

Patrick: SEE HIM?

HE'S FROM THE LIBRARY.

HE KNOWS ABOUT MY OVERDUE BOOKS.

SpongeBob: [GASPING]

UHHUH.

WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA GET
THROWN IN THE BIG HOUSE.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

SMALLPORTION MEALS?

EXACTLY!

[CRYING]

PATRICK, DON'T YOU WORRY.

I GOT YOUR BACK, MAN.

AHEM, HI, THERE.

SALUTATIONS, YOUNG ONE.

SAY, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW THE STARFISH THAT LIVES
UNDER THIS ROCK, WOULD YOU?

HUH?

NO, I DON'T KNOW ANY STARFISH.

HEH, EVEN IF I DID KNOW
THIS "ALLEGED" STARFISH,

PATRICK WOULDN'T OWE
ANY OVERDUE LIBRARY BOOKS.

WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU DON'T KNOW PATRICK STAR,

BECAUSE I AM FROM
THE ROYAL MINISTRY AND HAVE
A GIFT FOR HIM.

OOH, WHAT IS IT?

OH, PRETTY.

THIS IS
THE WORSTTASTING GIFT, EVER.

THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR IT,
NOT EAT IT.

ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

IT'S HERE... AHHA!

WHAT I HOLD IN MY HANDS
IS A FAMILY TREE
THAT GOES BACK CENTURIES.

IT STARTS WITH THE MARRIAGE OF
KING AMOEBA AND QUEEN MILDEW.

THEN, THROUGH A FEW
INBRED GENERATIONS,
ENDS AT YOU, SIR PATRICK.

WHICH MAKES YOU
A DESCENDANT OF ROYALTY.

YOU ARE A KING.

AND NOW, IT'S TIME I ADJOURNED
TO THE ROYAL MINISTRY,

WHERE I SHALL BE
AT YOUR SERVICE, YOUR HIGHNESS.

WOW, PATRICK, THAT'S GREAT!

WHAT IS?

THAT YOU'RE KING!

WHAT'S A KING?

WHEN YOU'RE A KING,
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

ANYTHING I WANT?

[RUMBLING]

SPONGEBOB, DO YOU THINK
WE COULD GET SOMETHIN' TO EAT?

YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND,
YOUR MAJESTY.

[LAUGHING]

SpongeBob: GOOD TOWNSPEOPLE,

LET US REJOICE IN WELCOMING
OUR NEW KING.

KING NEEDS FOOD, BADLY.

WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOU[GASPING]

WELL, WELL, WELL,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, PATRICK?

THE KING WOULD LIKE

ZIP IT, SQUAREPANTS.

I'M TALKING TO THE RICH GUY.

I'LL HAVE TEN KRABBY PATTIES,
A KRABBY MILKSHAKE,
LARGE FRIES...

I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEAR.

[EATING LOUDLY]

A BUFFET FIT FOR A KING.

[BURPING] TASTY.

LISTEN, PATRICK.

THERE COMES A TIME
IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE
WHEN HE'S GOTTA SETTLE DOWN.

YOU KNOW, GET A WIFE, KIDS,
A FATHERINLAW YOU GIVE ALL OF
YOUR MONEY TO.

UHHUH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

HEY, CAN I GET
A LITTLE MORE KETCHUP?

HOW'S ABOUT
YOU PAY THE CHECK, INSTEAD?

OH, SORRY, MR. KRABS.

NO CAN DO.

AS KING OF BIKINI BOTTOM,
I AM ALLOWED TO HAVE
ANYTHING I WANT.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SPONGEBOB?

THAT IS CORRECT.

ANYTHING YOU WANT,
AND IT'S ALLFREE.

[SHOUTING] ALL FREE?

Mr. Krabs: NOBODY EATS
IN ME RESTAURANT FOR FREE!

KING OR NO KING!

ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

I WAS PLANNING TO, WHY?

Patrick: I WANT IT.

HEY!

WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO TAKE MY FOOD?

[EATING LOUDLY]

DO I LOOK TOUGH?

I WOULDN'T MESS

SEE?

PATRICK,
THAT'S YOUR SALIVATION.

OH.

SO, SQUIDWARD,

ARE YOU READY
TO DO YOUR PART?

DOES THAT PART
INCLUDE LAUGHING
AT YOU?

BECAUSE YOU TWO LOOK
EVEN MORE IDIOTIC
THAN USUAL.

DON'T WE LOOK VICIOUS
AND BLOODTHIRSTY?

I'M BLOODTHIRSTY.

SEE?

[SLURPS]

WANT SOME?
OH, NO,
THANK YOU, PATRICK.

I'M DRINKING
DIET BLOOD.

HOW ABOUT
OUR BIKER ORGANIZATION?

NO!
I DON'T WANT TO JOIN

HI, MR. KRABS!

WE'RE
THE BIKINI BOTTOM BAD BOYS

THIS SHOULD BE GREAT!

THOSE BIKERS CAN WORK UP
AN APPETITE

BEATING YOU UP

THEN, THEY CAN FILL UP
ON DELICIOUS
KRABBY PATTIES.

THEN, THEY CAN
BEAT YOU UP AGAIN!

PLEASE, MR. KRABS.

WE'RE GOING TO RUN OFF
THOSE BIKERS AND SAVE
THE KRUSTY KRAB.

YOU'RE NOT
RUNNING OFF ANY OF
ME PAYING CUSTOMERS.

YOU CAN STAY
AND GET BEATEN UP
IN THE PARKING LOT,

IF YOU WISH.

THEN CAN WE SAVE
THE TOWN?

HAS IT EVER
CROSSED YOUR MIND

THAT YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING ALL WORKED UP
OVER NOTHING?

SQUIDWARD, WHEN

[SCOFFS]

YEAH, RIGHT.

YOU ARE SO WRONG ABOUT
EVERYTHING, SPONGEBOB,

THAT THE ONLY THING I AM
COMPLETELY SURE ABOUT

NOT FOR A $100!

I WOULDN'T EVEN SELL IT
FOR $1!

OH, REALLY!

YOU CAN'T HAVE IT FOR ANY PRICE.

AND WHY NOT?

THIS MEANS
MORE TO ME THAN MONEY.

IT'S MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB'S...

HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT?

BECAUSE YOU SAID IT.

I MADE YOU A NEW NET.

SpongeBob: "FOR SPONGEBOB."

YOU MADE ME
A NEW JELLYFISHING NET?

THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL OF YOU!

PATRICK?

This one's called
"Walk the Plank."

I'm already bored
with that one.

This one will blow that
little bird brain of yours.

Behold the "Patchy Patty."

Ahoy!

Aw, that's the worse one yet.

Bawk.

Potty Parrot, you are
never supportive of me!

I don't want to be
your friend anymore!

Bawk!

I never want to see you again!

Ah, Patchy, no!

[CRYING]

You know, this isn't the
first time that a patty has

come between two good chums.

It happened once
in Bikini Bottom.

Here, take a look while
I pull myself together.

[BUMPER MUSIC]

Something ain't right.

For me?

Don't you find this
a tad suspicious?

Suspicion doesn't hold a
candle to birthday wishing.

[INHALES LOUDLY]

Surprise!

[SCREAMING]

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

Ah!

Disengage!

MR. KRABS: Me secret formuler!

Happy birthday, Krabs!

Don't forget your
condiments, Plankton.

That a boy, SpongeBob.

Safe!

You'll rue the day
we were born, Krabs!

I'll be back!

Oh, barnacles.

[SCREAMING]

Why, Mr. Krabs?

Why does he hate us so?

Well, you might as well
blame me, SpongeBob.

There was a time when Plankton
and I were best friends.

Best friends?

Friends at birth,
you might say.

Even as wee ones.

Goo.

[IMITATING POPEYE LAUGH]

[FAWNING SOUND EFFECT]

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER): Things
were all peaches and cream.

[FAWNING SOUND EFFECT]

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
Until we hit grade school.

Hey, Plankey.

What you doing?

Oh, just a little something
I thought I'd try out.

[LAUGHING]

Idiots!

I'll show you with science!

This concoction's going
to blow everyone away!

[EXPLOSION]

[LAUGHING]

How's this for a
science experiment,

Mr. Brainatron 5000.

[SCREAMING]

They'll pay for
this one, eh, Eugene?

Darn tootin'!

Hey, barnacle brains!

I think you owe
Plankton an apolergy.

You're right.

Plankton, I'm sorry.

Sorry you have to
hang out with rag boy!

[LAUGHING]

Yeah.

Where'd you do your
clothes shopping?

In the trash can?

[LAUGHING]

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
It was true.

I did get me clothes
from the trash.

You see, when I was growing
up, times were tough.

Me mother had to fashion
me clothes from rags.

There you go, son.

Your outfit's all finished.

Well, it's a good thing Old
Man Jenkins was kind enough

to spare his last washcloth.

Oops!

I missed a spot.

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
Then one day

while Plankton and I plotted our
revenge, I met the love of me

life.

What in Neptune's net is that?

It's the most beautiful
thing me eyes have ever seen.

What is it?

It's money.

Money!

Yeah.

You could buy things with it.

Buy things?

So I spent it on a gift
for me best pal, Plankton.

[SCREAMING]

Wow!

Got your secret
recipe, Mr. Krabs.

You have no idea what that
went through to get here.

I got a pretty good idea, yeah.

Well, if you guys were such
great friends, what happened?

Yeah, Mr. Krabs.

What did happen next?

Yeah, I really want to know.

Listen up, Squidward, because
this is where it gets juicy.

It all began at a place
called Stinky Burgers.

It was the only place
to get a burger.

The kids loved Stinky Burger.

[CHATTER]

[LAUGHING]

Yay!

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
And Stinky loved the kids.

What can I do for
you, youngins?

Uh, Mr. Stinky?

I'll have one burger, please.

Me too, Stinky!

Oh, now, now, kids.

There's plenty of
burgers for everyone.

Yay!

That's why we like
you so much, Stinky.

You always deliver the goods!

We don't "like"
Stinky, we respect him.

Well, which one is it, kids?

Do you like or respect me?

Like!

Respect!

Like!

Respect!

STINKY: OK, let's just
meet in the middle

and say you "liespect" me.

[CHEERING]

Excuse us!

Valuable customers
coming through.

What are those
dorks doing here?

Two Stinky Burgers, please.

Did your brains dribble
out over the sidewalk

you slept on last night?

If it's burgers you
want, go around back.

CROWD: Yeah, Stinky!

Thanks for keeping
the nerds out!

You're the best, Stinky!

OK, that's enough, kids.

Gather around, children.

There's something
I want to tell you.

What I have to say
is very important.

If you remember just one thing
for the rest of your life,

remember that without
your kind patronage,

I'd be a penniless
loser like rag boy.

[KNOCKING]

Do you two have kelp for brains?

Don't you understand?

If you two yahoos
keep coming around,

you'll drive away all
the normal customers.

I've worked too long and
too hard to make this

a "liespectable" business.

As it is, I can barely afford
the essential things in life.

Is it quitting time already?

Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm off to enjoy

some of life's essentials.

Did you hear that, Krabs?

By cooking burgers for
those cretins, he was

able to gain their "liespect."

Did you see that
fat stack of loot.

I bet if someone
made a better burger,

we'd have a better
stack of loot.

But who has the ability
to make such a burger.

Who has the skill?

Skill, schmill, Krabs baby.

Who needs skill when
science is on your side?

We'll make that burger, and when
we do, we will rule the school!

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

I miss Potty.

I remember the first we met.

If I could only hear his voice.

Less talking and
more working, Cap.

Potty!

You came back to apologize.

I came to tell you
to get back to work.

You can't tell me what to
do, youassistant manager?

How did you get to
be assistant manager?

A little thing
called a GED, my man.

Oh, here we go with
the fancy book learning.

Customers love me cooking.

Why, we're almost
out of doggy bags.

[PUKING]

Oh, Potty.

What am I doing wrong?

You just need some
practice is all.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]

[COUGHING]

The patty's done.

Smells like an
actual poop deck.

Oh, fine.

I'll try it then.

By the crime of
befouling me tastebuds,

I order you to walk the plank!

Ah.

Oh, well.

I bet SpongeBob's first patty
didn't go so well either.

Bawk.

Roll film.

[BABY TALK]

[LAUGHING]

A perfect patty
on the first try.

D'oh!

I'll make a potty
patty out of you!

You're unsanitary, Patchy.

You keep hamburger
meat in an old boot.

Well, that's what gives
it its special flavor.

POTTY: You've got
rats in the kitchen.

D'oh, I brush and
shampoo them daily.

Who's Patchy's little princess?

Oh!

Don'tdo that!

And you can wash your hands
after using the bathroom.

What?

Every time?

That's not all.

This is a step in
the right direction.

What kind of a pirate
wears a hairnet?

The same kind that wears
a "Kiss the Cook" apron.

Well, you never know, Potty.

I might get lucky.

You hear that ladies?

Patchy is available?

Now I feel sick.

That's it, you feathered snake!

This time you've gone too far!

Bawk!

You missed.

Bawk.

Is that all you got?

Bawknow you've done it.

MR. PIRATESON: Aargh!

Aargh!

Yes, Mr. Pirateson.

You kids watch the
rest of the cartoon,

while I watch Potty get fired.

MR. PIRATESON: Aargh!

Coming, Mr. Pirateson.

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
So we went

back to our secret
hideawaythe dump

to prove to those chowderheads
that a burger could

be semiedible and
easy to swaller.

We made sure to keep careful
record of our progress.

PLANKTON: Gently.

Gently!

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER):
We finally

emerged with the bestlooking
burger under the sea!

We went back to Stinky's
to run our Patty

in those kid's greasy faces.

But Stinky's had been
shut down by the order

of the health department.

So we seized the
opportunity and converted

our hang out into a restaurant.

[LOUD HORN]

Our venture into
capitalism began.

$1, please.

There you are, sir.

MR. KRABS (VOICEOVER): It was
me first dollar I'd ever earned,

and it t'was also the beginning
of a beautiful, romantic

relationship with money.

KID: Hey!

Your burgers are even
worse than Stinky's.

We can barely keep them down.

If it wasn't for
Stinky's shutting down,

no one would eat here.

Now give me a
burger, I'm starving.

Just look at them, Eugene.

The very people who ridiculed me
are now feasting on my recipe.

I thought it was our recipe.

I'm ruling their stomachs.

And soon I will be
ruling their minds!

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER, THUNDERCLAP]

But what about
satisfying the customer?

Barnacles to the customer!

I'm talking about
ruling the world!

[LAUGHING, THUNDERCLAP]

And with this secret recipe,
nothing will stop me.

Give me that!

Stop!

You're going to bust it!

Ah!

Burgers aren't
for ruining worlds!

I'm terribly sorry,
Eugene, I couldn't hear you.

Could you come closer?

Maybe stand on the
tile in front of you?

Which one?

The one that says "eject" or
the one that says "trap door."

Oh, either one will do.

What I was saying
was(YELLING)

you'll regret this one day!

And he always did.

Lies!

[EXCLAIMS]

MR. KRABS: Whoa, hold
on there, me boy.

We don't need to go
through all that again.

Very touching, but
completely false.

Don't know what you mean.

Why don't you
tell him the truth?

It did happen that way,
didn't it, Mr. Krabs?

Most of it is true, except
for what really happened!

We had created the
tastiest burger.

That's when things
became unsavory.

First, I rule their stomachs.

And then their money!

[MANIACAL LAUGHTER, THUNDERCLAP]

But what about
satisfying the customers?

Barnacles to the customers.

[EXCLAIMS]

I'm talking about coins,
cash, wallets, bank accounts!

With this secret recipe,
nothing will stop me!

Give me that!

Stop!

You're going to bust it.

This isn't about money, Eugene.

Milarky.

You'll regret this one day!

PLANKTON: Our little squabble
only got me part of the recipe.

Gosh, Mr. Plankton.

That doesn't sound like
the Mr. Krabs story at all.

KAREN: That's because it isn't.

Karen?

They're both liars.

That's not how it
happened at all.

In those days, I was
just starting out

as a security system.

Plankton and I met
when he installed me.

It was only our third date.

Anyway, I recorded the
whole thing in my databanks.

Now that's a handsome
looking burger.

You said it, old chum!

Attention, get your Plankton
and Krabs' patties right here.

You think it was a good
idea to open in a dump?

What's that music?

I know that theme
song anywhere.

It's Old Man Jenkins.

Old Man Jenkins!

I've just been searching for
some new shoes for Old Bessey.

You help me mom and me
through some tough times.

It would be an honor if
you'd be the first to try

our delicious burgers.

Why, I'd be happy to.

Yay!

MR. KRABS: "Plab Patty" KOs
Old Man J. I can't believe

we poisoned that sweet old guy.

Well, he is old.

Hey.

That guy's like family to me.

Well, it was your fault
the patty was tainted.

You're the one who put too much
seaweed sauce in the burger.

You let it sit out too long.

That's what did it.

I'm taking the
recipe and fixing it.

No way!

That recipe's mine!

Stop!

You're gonnaYou want to fight
over this recipe, I'll give you

a fight you'll never forget!

Well, that's ruined.

But, no use letting
this go to waste.

These kids'll eat anything.

I've done it.

I discovered the
perfect patty batter!

KAREN (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, Plankton was

back at the elementary school.

But this he was going it alone.

PLANKTON: Ah!

Oh, no you don't.

This is my turf.

I think not, rag boy!

What?

Why I oughta squash you
right now, you little

Get out of my face!

[GROWLING]

Hey, look.

Nerd fight!

I've got $5 on rag boy.

Aha!

We'll let the customers
decide whose burger's better.

Step right up, gents.

Get a delicious Chum
Burger right here.

Big Johnny will eat anything.

Have a Chum
Burger, Johnny, sir.

KAREN (VOICEOVER): Plankton,
he had pieced together

his own creation using
memory and science.

Go on, sir.

Tell your buddies
what you think.

I'm going to try one
of rag boy's burgers.

Here you are, sir.

You are the first to
taste a Krabby Patty.

Flavor!

Edible!

We can actually hold it down!

This is the most
flavortastic sensation

my still developing taste
buds have ever experienced!

I'll show you, Krabs!

I'll steal that cursed
recipe from you one day,

and I won't stop 'til I do.

My recipe was, is, and
always will be the best!

You wouldn't have that
recipe if it weren't for me.

You calling me a liar?

Will you men stop
yelling at each other?

I can't believe you
let a recipe ruin

such a wonderful friendship.

You were my only true
friend that didn't have

a president printed on him.

But money doesn't hug back.

My life has been nothing but
a long line of disappointment

since we became enemies.

All these years I've been
trying to steal your formula.

But I was really just trying
to steal back our friendship.

Really?

It's all I ever really wanted.

To get back to the
way it used to be.

You and me against the world.

How about a hug, Krabs old pal?

I'd like that, Planky old chum.

[SOBBING]

Doesn't it warm
your heart, Karen?

I suppose it would.

If I had one.

I'm sorry, Krabs old buddy.

Me, too.

Me, too.

Now, Karen!

Back off, rag boy!

[LAUGHING]

Sabotage!

Go, Karen!

Ho, that Plankton never
learns, does he, kids?

As for me, I decided
to take some time

off to catch up on me reading.

You didn't take time off.

You got fired!

Hey!

You got fired too.

I've got a golden parachute.

Well, at least I know they'll
never be able to replace me.

Squawk.

Looks like they already did.

What?

They let a smelly, hairy flea
bag like that serve food?

[MUTTERING]

PATCHES: Don't, please!

I have a tomato allergy.

Ow!

Right in the bun.

Ow!

Ooh, ow!

NARRATOR: And so, kids, always
remember to follow your dreams.

Unless you're Patchy.

Then just stay in bed.

I WAS ON MY WAY

WHEN I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
A LITTLE TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.

GOOD OLD JIM.

WHEN YOU WORKED HERE,
THE PLACE HAD CLASS.

YEAH, WHEN THIS PLACE
HAD CLASS...

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]

[LAUGHING]

WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT TIMES, TOO,

NO.

HEY, THAT'S NEW.

NO ONE COULD EVER

SPONGEBOB, SWEEP UP THIS MESS
WHILE JIM AND I CATCH UP.

YES, SIR.

AFTER I LEFT THE KRUSTY KRAB,
I WORKED AT SOME OF THE FINEST
RESTAURANTS AROUND THE WORLD.

I GOT SO SUCCESSFUL,
I WAS ABLE TO RETIRE IN LUXURY.

WOULD YOU SIGN MY KRABBY PATTY?

OH, I DON'T SIGN
WHAT I DIDN'T MAKE.

HEY, BIG SHOT, WHY DON'T YOU
STEP BEHIND THE FRYER,
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

YOU'RE ON, KRABS.

BUT I'LL HAVE TO CHARGE YOU.

[LAUGHS]

OH, OH, YOU ALWAYS KNEW
HOW TO MAKE ME LAUGH.

YOU JUST DON'T FIND EMPLOYEES
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.
[LAUGHS]

YEAH, NOT UNLESS YOU LOOKED 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!

[GASPS]
YOU'RE RIGHT, BOY.

I APPRECIATE YOU, SQUIDWARD.

NOW I FEEL COMPLETE.

NOW HOW'S ABOUT THAT PATTY?

EVERYONE, WATCH AND LEARN.

NO ONE WATCHES JIM.

ONE PATTY, THE RIGHTWAY.

[CHEERING]

IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY.

WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT A JIM PATTY, ANYWAY?

EH, IT'S O.K.

WOW...

THAT WAS... AMAZING.

UM, MR. JIM, SIR?

OH, HEY... YOU.

YOU'RE THE...
GUY WHO SWEEPS UP, RIGHT?

I'M THE NEW FRY COOK, SIR.

OH.

YOU MADE THAT STEPPEDON THING
I SAW EARLIER, RIGHT?

DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS
YOU COULD PASS ON TO A ROOKIE?

HMM, BESIDES
DON'T STEP ON THE FOOD?

PLEASE CRITIQUE MY WORK!

I WISH TO LEARN

WHY, SQUIDWARD?

BECAUSE WHEN JIM LEAVES,
I'LL BE STUCK WITH YOUAGAIN.

DON'T WORRY SQUIDWARD.

JIMWON'T BE LEAVING.

HE'S TAKING MY JOB.

I'M THE ONE WHO'S LEAVING.

SPONGEBOB'S RESIGNATION!

OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE.

NO ONE'S MAKING PATTIES.

AND THAT MEANS
I'M NOT MAKING MONEY!

HEY, EUGENE, WHERE'S THAT
LITTLE FRY COOK OF YOURS?

HE THINKS YOU'RE TAKING HIS JOB,
SO HE'S RUN OFF.

HEY, GREAT IDEA,
AND YOU CAN GIVE ME A RAISE.

[LAUGHING]

SpongeBob: LOOK AT THEM.

MR. KRABS IS PROBABLY OFFERING
JIM MY JOB RIGHT NOW.

[LAUGHING]

[SIGHS]

WELL, I BETTER GO FIND HIM.

SPONGEBOB?

DON'T WORRY, MR. KRABS,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

I'M NOT FIT TO INHABIT
THE SAME KITCHEN AS JIM.

SO IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART
THAT I RELINQUISH MY POSITION
AS FRY COOK.

WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, SPONGEBOB?

I'M NOT TAKING YOUR JOB.

BUT YOU'RE THE GREATEST FRY COOK
IN THE WORLD.

THE KRUSTY KRAB
DESERVES BETTER THAN ME.

BOTH THOSE STATEMENTS
ARE TRUE, SPONGEBOB.

BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY
I LEFT THE KRUSTY KRAB.

IT ALL STARTED
ON A WARM SUMMER EVENING.

Jim: BUSINESS WAS SLOW

SO SQUIDWARD AND I WERE HAVING
ONE OF OUR FAMOUS BULL SESSIONS.

WE SHOULD OPEN
OUR OWN RESTAURANT AND STOP
LINING OLD MAN K'S POCKETS.

NO, THANKS.

I'M JUST DOING THIS UNTIL
MY CLARINET CAREER TAKES OFF.

WHAT IF IT NEVER DOES?

DON'T YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO FALL BACK ON?

YEAH, HA!

I COULD LOSE MY BEAUTIFUL
FLOWING HAIR TOO, BUT I'M NOT
BUYING A WIG YET.

WELL, WHILE YOU GO WIG SHOPPING,
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO MR. KRABS.

HEY, MR. KRABS.

YOU GOT A SECOND?

ANYTHING FOR YOU,
JIMMY ME BOY.

COP A SQUAT AND LAY YOUR RACKET.

TELL ME WHAT'S ON YOUR WIG, JIM.

CUT THE GAS, KRABS,
AND DIG THIS.

I'VE BEEN
BUSTING MY CONCH FOR YOU.

YOU BETTER LAY ON SOME
EXTRA GRAVY, OR I'M GONNA
AGITATE THE GRAVEL.

WHAT NOW?

YOU KNOW, LAY A PATCH.

EXCUSE ME?

GIVE ME A RAISE OR I'M QUITTING.

A "RAISE"?

HMM, THAT'S NOT
IN MY HIPTIONARY.

HELP ME GET WITH IT, JACK.

STOP TALKING LIKE THAT.

THESE SIDEBURNS AREN'T REAL.

I NEED MORE MONEY
IN MY PAYCHECK AT THE END
OF EVERY WEEK, CAPISCE?

[LAUGHING...]

MY HAIR,
MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

Squidward: MY HAIR, MY HAIR.

[LAUGHS]

AH, IT'S STILL AS FUNNY TODAY
AS IT WAS THEN.

[SIGHS]

[MOANS]

YOU SEE, SPONGEBOB.

YOU'VE GOT ONE QUALITY
JIM WILL NEVER HAVE.

YOU'RE CHEAP.

WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
THAT WAY.

SO YOU'LL STAY?

AYEAYE, MR. KRABS.

THEN GET TO WORK, LAD!

WELL, EUGENE, LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
GOT YOURSELF ANOTHER SUCKER.

THE KID'S A GOOD FRY COOK

BUT HE'LL ONLY BE
A GREAT FRY COOK

WHEN HE FINALLY
GETS THE GUTS TO QUIT THIS DUMP.

GOOD LUCK, SPONGEBOB.

YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

THE KRUSTY KRAB ISN'T A DUMP.

OH, SHE'S A DUMP, ALL RIGHT.

BUT SHE'S MY DUMP.

OH...

WE'VE GOT 50 ORDERS TO FILL.

NOW GO IN THE COOLER

SpongeBob: YOU WANT ME

[GULPS]
THERE?

[SINISTER LAUGHTER]

[SCREAMS]
SAVE ME!

THE DARKNESS!

[GRUNTS]

NOW LOOK, LAD.

YOUR WORK IS STARTING TO
AFFECT ME PROFITS.

YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF
SOME SHUTEYE.

WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET YOURSELF A NIGHT LIGHT?

NIGHT LIGHT?

YEAH, BOY.

IT'LL KEEP YOUR ROOM LIT
SO YOU WON'T BE SCARED STIFF.

GREAT IDEA, MR. KRABS.

NIGHT LIGHTS... NIGHT LIGHTS...

[GASPS]

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

EXCUSE ME.

ARE THESE NIGHTLIGHTS GUARANTEED

TO KEEP THE CREEPY CREATURES
OF THE DARK AWAY?

[SIGHS]
IF I ANSWER YES,
WILL YOU LEAVE THE STORE SOONER?

NOW THAT I CAN SEE, WHOOHOO!

I CAN SLEEP.

[YAWNS]

[SCREAMS]

I WONDER WHAT'S IN MY DARK,
SCARYLOOKING BATHROOM.

[WHIMPERING]

[SCREAMS]

NIGHT LIGHT, NIGHT LIGHT!

OH, THANK YOU.

WHEW.

[SCREAMS]

[GASPING]
ANOTHER LIGHT, PLEASE.

OH, THANK YOU.

[GASPS]

[SCREAMS]

[SCREAMS...]

THERE, THERE, THERE, AND THERE.

I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CHANGE
YOUR TAIL LIGHT ANYWAY, GARY.

[LAUGHS]

NOW THERE'S NOT
ONE SQUARE INCH OF DARK.

MEOW.

WHAT WAS THAT GARY?

MEOW.

[GASPS]

[GASPS]
YOU'RE RIGHT, GARY.

I'VE GOT DARKNESS INSIDE OF ME!

HEY, SPONGEBOB'S HAVING
A PARTY WITHOUT ME?

THROW A PARTY WITHOUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THATAUGH!

THAT WAS CLOSE, PATRICK.

YOU'RE SAFE HERE
UNDER THESE NIGHT LIGHTS.

BUT YOU GOTTA STAY OUT OF
THE DARK, BUDDY!

YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CREEPING CRITTER COULD
BE LURKING IN THOSE SHADOWS.

[GASPS AND WHIMPERS]

WAIT, PATRICK!

WHAT IS THAT, GARY?

PATRICK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

OH, I HAD TO MOVE MY ROCK
OUT OF THE DARK AND INTO
THE LIGHT.

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS...

SLEEP OVER!

YOUR SLEEPING BAG, SIR.

THANK YOU, MY GOOD MAN.

[♪...]

[LAUGHING]

OH, PATRICK, I'M SO GLAD
YOU MADE THAT GAPING HOLE
IN THE WALL.

LETTING IN ALL THETHTHTH...

[SCREAMING]

[WHIMPERING]

[SQUIDWARD SNORES]

[SCREAMS]

BURNING, AUGH!

[SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK WHIMPER]

I CAN FEEL IT, PAT,
THE DARKNESS.

LIKE IT'S CREEPING UP ON US.

WHAT ARE YOU TWO
WHIMPERING ABOUT?

[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMS]

IT'S ME, SQUIDWARD, YOU IDIOTS.

HI, SQUIDWARD.

LISTEN, GUYS.

I DON'T CARE OR WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME

BUT COULD YOU
TURN OFF ALL THESE LIGHTS?

BUT SQUIDWARD,
WITHOUT OUR NIGHT LIGHTS

THE CREEPY CREATURES
OF THE DARK...

OH, SPONGEBOB, THERE ARE NO
"CREEPY CREATURES OF THE DARK."

IT'S ALL IN YOUR IMAGINATION.

NO, SQUIDWARD!

DON'T GO OUT IN THE DARK!

[GROANS]

OH, WHY WON'T HE LISTEN?

PATRICK, MAYBE
SQUIDWARD'S RIGHT.

WHAT IF ALL THIS IS
JUST IN OUR IMAGINATION?

IN THAT CASE,
WE'LL NEED EVEN MORE LIGHTS.

YOU SAID IT, PAT.

QUICK, SPONGEBOB.

TURN IT ON.

[♪...]

MORE LIGHT!

NOW, SPONGEBOB!

MORE LIGHT!

Man: The batteryoperated spoon
has saved me so much time.

THIS IS WHAT PASSES FOR
INFOTAINMENT THESE DAYS?

SWEET MOTHER OF
NEPTUNE'S MOTHER!

LOOK, BARNACLE BOY!

A CALL TO ACTION!

[BRAKES SQUEAL]

MORE LIGHTS, SPONGEBOB.

MORE LIGHTS.

MERMAID MAN!

BARNACLE BOY!

AW, ARE YOU GUYS HERE
TO PROTECT US FROM THE DARKNESS
THAT SURROUNDS US?

WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR CHILDISH GAMES.

WE'RE RESPONDING TO THE DISTRESS
SIGNAL THAT YOU SENT.

OH, I'M SORRY,
MERMAID MAN AND BARNACLE BOY.

THERE APPEARS TO BE
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

YOU SEE, PATRICK AND I PUT UP
ALL THESE LIGHTS TO SCARE AWAY
THE MONSTERS IN THE DARK.

WE WEREN'T TRYING TO SUMMON YOU.

OH, FIDDLESTICKS, SPONGEBOB.

DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR US, IN OUR ADVANCED AGE,TO MOVE?

DON'T SHINE A GIANT LIGHT
IN THE SKY UNLESS THERE'S
A REAL EMERGENCY.

[SINISTER LAUGH]

AND ANOTHER THING...

WHAT THE?

DEAR NEPTUNE!

IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS
AND FOREBODING OF ALL
OUR ARCHNEMESIS!

I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

WHY ARE WE HERE AGAIN?

What's making that noise?

[SHUTTERING]

Oh, it's you again.

OK, joke's over.

All right, you got me.

Now cut it out.

That's it!

Stop doing that, mister.

I'm warning you!

Stop it!

I said quit it!

Then where's it coming from?

Make it stop.

Buddy, you gotta help
me find out where

that ringing is coming from.

Hey, come back!

Oh, fine!

I'll ask someone who cares.

SpongeBob, where's the
ringing coming from?

[GROWLING]

Breakfast!

Come to Patrick!

Tartar sauce.

I'm out of food again.

All I have are these lousy cans
with pictures of food on them.

I wanted real
food, not pictures!

Oh.

The food is in the can!

OK, come on out.

Come on.

Oh, yeah.

OK, breakfast.

Get on the plate.

Come on.

Nice, comfy plate just for you.

Come on.

Get on there.

Hello?

Anybody in there?

[DIAL TONE]

No answer.

I'm coming to rescue you!

Having a little
trouble reaching you.

Oh, stupid cans.

Oh, food.

Ah, my favorite time of the day.

Breakfast and a little
morning television.

HOST (ON TV): And now,
live from Bikini Bottom,

Just send in 99 box tops!

How are you doing

I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

I'm waiting

PATRICK: I'm waiting.

We're waiting, we're waiting

We're waiting.

SpongeBob?

What are we waiting for?

We're waiting for the mailman.

He's bringing me a free toy.

Oh, I love toys!

Can I wait for
your toy with you?

Why, sure!

We're waiting, we're
waiting, we're waiting.

There's the mailman!

You SpongeBob SquarePants?

Yep!

Isn't there anything else?

Nope.

Sorry, kid.

Guess we'll have
to keep waiting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[GROWLING]

Hey, SpongeBob?

I'm hungry.

[GROWLING]

[BARKING]

Me too.

Let's go down to the Krusty
Krab for a Krabby Patty!

Great idea, Patrick!

Krusty Krab, here
wewait a minute!

What if the mailman
comes when I'm gone?

What's wrong, SpongeBob?

If I leave, the mailman might
come and I might miss him.

Oh, I'm going to take off then.

I don't think my arm could
stand much more of this.

[BITING, GROWLING]

Got to stay focused.

Hiya!

Hey, SpongeBob!

Want to do some kara

Now now.

I'm busy.

Oh, Gary.

Not now.

Can't you see that I'm
waiting for the mailman?

Why can't anyone
understand this?

[PANTING]

So tired.

So hungry.

But, must wait for toy.

Hey, buddy.

What!

What do you want!

Can't you see I'm
doing something here?

This better be good.

You missed your
surprise birthday party,

so I just wanted to bring
you a present and some cake

because you missed it.

My birthday party?

I missed my birthday party?

Yeah.

See?

Here's a president
and your cake.

My birthday cake.

Yeah.

Well, let me just get you
a fork so you can eat it.

Uh, let me just hold
the cake like this

so I can get you a fork.

Huh, I wonder where
I put that fork.

Oops.

That was my cake.

What is the present?

Oh, yeah!

The fork!

[SOBBING]

That stupid toy!

I've wasted my whole
life waiting for it!

Actually, you've only
been here 20 minutes.

I've been mean to Gary
and I flipped Sandy!

And now you hate me
because I'm a big jerk!

No, I don't.

Yes, you do.

SpongeBob SquarePants?

Could you come back later?

He's having a moment.

Yeah, I just need
his signature for

I said he's having a moment!

Now leave him alone!

No, Patrick.

People like me don't
deserve moments.

I get so caught up inhere you

[LAUGHING]

Woo!

Woo, yeah!

Patrick, are you thinking
what I'm thinking.

SpongeBob

I waited so long.

SpongeBob.

And you broke it.

You OK, buddy?

Yes.

Yes, I'm OK.

Oh, for a sec, I

You!

You ruined my free toy!

I'm sorry!

Maybe if you just

Just keep walking, Squiddy.

Don't make eye contact.

Now to soothe my frayed nerves.

[SCREAMING]

All right!

What's going on?

Why are you two crying?

[STAMMERING]

I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

And then, he came, and then,
we're waiting, we're waiting.

And then my toy, and then you,
and then snap, and then this.

[SOBBING]

There.

Now, see?

It's supposed to do that.

Hey!

My toy's OK!

Good.

Now will you two be quiet?

Look, Patrick.

Squidward fixed it.

How can we ever thank you?

Yeah, how can we thank you?

Move to another neighborhood.

[BUMPER SONG]

[SNORING]

Krabby Patty.

Meow!

[SNORING]

[GIGGLING]

Gary, what are you doing?

Meow.

SPONGEBOB: Oh, my gosh!

Your bowl is empty.

Not to worry, GarGar.

Food is on the way.

Faster than you can say organic!

Meow.

There you go, Gary.

[RETCHES]

Gary, shame on you.

I realize you're a bottom
feeder, but have some manners!

You know you're not supposed
to eat goop off the ground.

Now go on and enjoy
your health food.

[GROWLING]

What is this stuff anyway?

It doesn't seem
to be coming off.

[DOORBELL]

Oh!

Company!

Hi, Spongebodeh!

Something wrong, Patrick?

SpongeBob, what is that?

What's what?

This!

SPONGEBOB: Ah!

[PANTING]

Patrick, what should I do?

Scratch it like
there's no tomorrow!

Good idea.

Uh, SpongeBob?

Yeah?

PATRICK: I don't
know about this.

What makes you say that?

This?

[STAMMERING]

It's getting bigger!

Nothing a little pimple
cream can't cure.

Ah, that's more like it.

All better.

See, Patrick?

Sure do.

Well, I'm going to
go sit in my hole.

Catch you later, pal.

Bye, Patrick.

[HUMMING LOUDLY]

Ah, that feels better.

Let's see.

A fourletter
wordoohmeaning

an uncomfortable
sensation on the dermis.

Hmm.

Oh, itch!

[PANTING]

Don't worry, SpongeBob.

Everyone gets itchy, swollen
skin rash now and then.

Just don't scratch
it and it'll go away.

Eventually.

There.

Out of sight, out of mind.

I won't let this minor
setback hinder my fry cooking.

[HUMMING]

Now, nothing can distract me
from frying up those patties.

Except maybe this
unbearable itchiness.

Must stop scratching!

SpongeBob, ah!

[PANTING]

SpongeBob!

Eh?

Oh, hi, Squidward.

SpongeBob, why
are you all puffy?

Uh, whatty?

Your skin, SpongeBob.

What's wrong with your skin?

Oh, that?

It's nothing really, Squidward.

Just a little
blemish, that's all.

[SCREAMING]

That's no blemish!

Help me!

Oh, I'll help you all right.

[BEEPING]

[PHONE RINGING]

SWAT team.

[GIBBERISH]

We'll be right over.

Hold it right there!

Dear Neptune's trident.

This is the most
severe case of ick yet.

Stop, you fool!

Do you want to get infected?

This is a job for
the hazmat division.

Get back!

I said get back!

Back, I say!

What's going on, Squidward?

Ah!

Here's your change, sir.

Oh, why thank you
very much, young man.

What was that?

No, no, Mr. Squidward,
that can't be the ick.

Oh, where am I?

Whoa!

Who are you people?

I wanna go home.

You are home, SpongeBob.

You just need to stay in this
bubble until the ick clears up.

Where's my snail, Gary?

We've taken care of your pet.

Meow.

Gary?

Wow!

He appears stable, sir.

All right, boys.

Let's pack it up.

Huh?

What is this?

Patrick, stop, stop!

You're gonna pop it!

Really?

How about if I
squeeze it like this?

Or this?

No!

Or this?

Oh, Patrick!

How many times to
I have to tell you?

Be careful!

Sorry.

Hey, want to play a game
of pirate wrestling?

Good.

Let's begin.

[TEARING]

Um.

Patrick?

I win.

I win, I win!

Patrick?

Go Patrick.

Go Patrick.

Go Patrick.

Patrick!

What am I going to do?

My bubble is destroyed.

I've got an idea!

There's no time for games, Pat.

Now, think, SpongeBob.

The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

Hm?

Patrick, you're a genius!

And this one's mobile.

Now I can go back to work.

Squidward!

Help!

Help me flip these patties.

We've got growling
stomachs out there.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Then would it be
too much trouble

to ask his high and mightiness
to take these patties out

to the customers?

Oh, if only SpongeBob were here.

If SpongeBob were here,
we'd be covered in ick.

Lunch is served.

Eat up, kids.

Oh, why am I so itchy?

No!

[SCREAMING]

SpongeBob gave me the ick, and
I gave it to all you people!

[YELLING]

Stay back you diseased freaks!

What's all the commotion about?

The commotion, my dear Krabs,
is regarding the hygiene

standards of your
eating establishment,

which appear to be inadequate.

Inadequate?

I'll have you know this
staff at the Krusty Krab

take a solemn pledge to show
up every day of the week

clean and disease free.

SPONGEBOB: Sorry
I'm late, Mr. Krabs.

SpongeBob SquarePants
returning for duty, sir.

[EXCLAIMING]

Is that what you consider
clean and disease free, Krabby?

I say we ransack this
greasy disease shack.

Who's with me?

[YELLING]

It wasn't me.

It was Squidward.

He gave you all the ick.

No.

No, I didn't.

It was SpongeBob.

He's infected the
entire Krusty Krab!

[YELLING]

Let us apprehend that
callous contaminator!

[YELLING]

[SCREAMING]

[RETCHING]

[GROWLING]

Meow.

[SOBBING]

Stop!

You're pushing out
more of the ick!

No!

[GIGGLING]

Ah, stop it!

You're tickling me, Squidward!

It's not me, Mr. Krabs.

Gary the Snail!

Don't you know it's impolite
to feed off of other people

without permission?

He's just doing
his job, SpongeBob.

He's a bottom feeder, remember?

See?

The little fella
licked me clean.

I'm cured!

And he'll clean the
ick off any service.

Even Squid!

Oh, oh.

Me next.

Where are your manners?

It's ladies first.

I believe the expression
is starfish first.

I supersede all of you,
for I have an exotic accent.

Hey, hey, hey.

There's no need to fight.

I got a solution
I'll be happy with.

Step up to me deick.

Only $5.

Now, can I get you get
you a Krabby Patty?

In light of today's
events, that notion

is crass and offensive.

I'll take two, please.

All right!

Here you go, Mr. Krabs.

Another $5 for
another deicking!

Look, Gar!

You made me all sparkly!

You're the best bottomfeeder
a sponge could ever have.

Ah, and a great money
maker you are, too.

Now back to work!

PLANKTON HASN'T TRIED TO STEAL
THE FORMULA IN OVER A MONTH.

HE MUST BE PLANNING
SOMETHING BIG.

HELLO.

ONE OF YOU WILL HAVE TO
VOLUNTEER FOR SOME EXTRA WORK.

GOODBYE.

I WAS JUST GONNA ASK IF SOMEONE
COULD SPY ON PLANKTON.

SPY?

OOH!

HEY, SPONGEBOB, I CAN SEE YOU

PATRICK, I'M GONNA BE A SPY!

YOU'RE A SPY?

I WANT TO BE A SPY, TOO!

SHH, OK, OK.

YOU CAN BE A SPY.

JUST BE QUIET.

HOORAY!

THIS KRABBY PATTY, BUT REMEMBER

THE FATE OF THE KRUSTY KRAB
RESTS IN YOUR HANDS, SPONGEBOB.

IN MY HANDS.

OOH.

OOH.

[BEEPING]

Krabs: Your mission,
if you choose to accept it

is to discover
what Plankton's up to.

Don't let him out of your sight.

You'll need to rustle up
some spy gadgets.

If you don't accept it,
you're fired.

This patty will selfdestruct
in 10 seconds.

[BEEPING...]

[SCREAMING]

GET RID OF IT.

GET RID OF IT, PATRICK.

THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A MARK.

HI, SANDY.

HEY, SPONGEBOB, PATRICK.

WHAT Y'ALL DOIN'?

DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
SPYING, SANDY?

WELL, I KNOW YOU NEED
A LOT OF CRAZY GADGETS,

BERMUDA SHORTS

WHAT DO WE DO NOW, PATRICK?

[SNORING]

[GIGGLING]

WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

NOTHING YET.

WAIT, WAIT, HE'S...

BUYING BABY CLOTHES?

WE GOT TO GET CLOSER.

EXCUSE ME.

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING

[CHUCKLING]

UH, SORRY, BUD.

THAT'S AS SMALL AS THEY COME.

[SIGHING]

WOW, PLANKTON HAS TO
BUY BABY CLOTHES?

HOW EMBARRASSING.

SPONGEBOB TO KRABS.

COME IN, KRABS.

KRABS HERE.

GO AHEAD.

PLANKTON JUST BOUGHT
SOME BABY CLOTHES.

BABY CLOTHES?

HM.

WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

HOLD ON.

HE'S BUYING...

YEAH, YEAH?

A STAMP.

A STAMP.

THIS IS THE MOST
ELABORATE SCHEME EVER.

KEEP ON HIM, SPONGEBOB.

WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND HIM,
AND HE HAS NO IDEA.

[LOUD STOMPING]

[GROWLING]

WOULD YOU STOP MAKING
ALL THAT RACKET?

[INDISTINCT MUTTERING...]

WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

I CAN'T TELL.

PHEW, GOSH, IT'S HOT.

CAN DO.

PHEW.

HUH?

I'M AFRAID

Exactly, so get to work!

Operator: If you'd like to make
a call, please deposit 25 cents.

[DIAL TONE]

SpongeBob: OK, PATRICK,
WE'RE IN POSITION.

NOW, HOW DO WE GET INSIDE?

I THINK THE FRONT DOOR'S OPEN.

SPIES DON'T USE
THE FRONT DOOR, PATRICK.

WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
A COMPLICATED WAY TO GET INSIDE.

THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB
FOR PATRICK STAR LASER PANTS.

OOH.

[GROANING]

[SCREAMING]

GOOD WORK, PATRICK.

NOW, IT'S MY TURN.

[GRUNTING]

I THOUGHT YOU WERE HOLDING
THE ROPE.

I AM.

YOU NEED TO BE QUIET.

WE'RE ON A SECRET MISSION.

Plankton: SECRET MISSION, EH?

[SCREAMING]

DON'T YOU THINK
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO?

YOU WANT TO EAT AT
THE CHUM BUCKET WITHOUT
YOUR BOSS KNOWING.

KAREN, WE'VE GOT A CUSTOMER.

I'LL LET YOU TWO
LOOK OVER THE MENU.

SPONGEBOB, I HAVE TO GO.

OH, CAN'T YOU GO LATER?

DESTROY MY LAB, WILL YOU, KRABS?

WELL, IF IT'S WAR YOU WANT,

MY CATARACT SURGERY TOO LONG?

NO, MR. KRABS,
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE MONTH.

Krabs: MERCIFUL NEPTUNE!

MAN YOUR BATTLE STATIONS.

I'M ON IT.

[ALARM BLARING]

[TOILET FLUSHING]

BRING IT ON, PLANKTON.

Plankton: OH, I WILL.

WE'LL SEE IF YOU HAVE
A CUSTOMER LEFT AFTER
I PUMP UP THE VOLUME.

[MUZAK PLAYS LOUDLY]

OH, BROTHER.

I HATED THE REAL VERSION
OF THIS SONG.

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]

HE'S DRIVING ME CUSTOMERS AWAY.

ALL RIGHT, PLANKTON,
YOU WANT MY CUSTOMERS SO BADLY?

YOU CAN HAVE 'EM.

DO YOUR WORST, KRABS!

I HATE MY JOB.

IT'S UP TO YOU AND ME, BUDDY.

ABANDON SHIP.

[SCREAMING]

POINTYHEADED PROJECTILE
ON THE PORT SIDE.

[CHUCKLING]

[GASPING]

NO!

I WIN!

I ALWAYS WIN!

NOT TO RAIN ON
YOUR PARADE OR ANYTHING,
BUT YOU ALWAYS LOSE.

NO, SPONGEBOB, I ALWAYS WIN.

[GASPING]

MR. KRABS?

THAT'S RIGHT.

I STOLE ME OWN FORMULA.

BUT IF YOU'RE MR. KRABS,
THEN WHO'S...?

SpongeBob: MR. KRABS IS A ROBOT!

NO, YOU IDIOT.

SpongeBob: PLANKTON?

WHAT THE BARNACLES
IS GOING ON HERE?

YOU SEE, WE HAD A BET.

PLANKTON'S BEEN TRYING
FOR 20 YEARS

TO STEAL THE FORMULA,
AND HE'S NEVER DONE IT.

I ALMOST HAD IT 37 TIMES,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

TELL IT TO THE CLAW, SISTER.

LAST TIME HE FAILED,
WE MADE A BET.

[LAUGHING]

YOU CAN'T BEAT ME, PLANKTON.

I ALWAYS WIN.

[SOBBING]

YOU'VE GOT THE EASY PART.

I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU DO MYJOB.

OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

IF I WAS YOU, I COULD STEAL
THE FORMULA ON ME FIRST TRY.

HAH!

THE USUAL WAGER?

YOU'RE ON.

SO, THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS
FAR TOO ELABORATE
TO GO INTO RIGHT NOW

WE FLAWLESSLY ASSUMED
EACH OTHER'S LIVES

AND I BEAT PLANKTON
AT HIS OWN GAME, AND DESTROYED
HIS PLACE OF BUSINESS.

[LAUGHING]

NOW PAY UP.

HERE YOU GO, EUGENE.

ONE DOLLAR.

NOT SO FAST.

SQUIDWARD?

THEN WHO ARE YOU?

I'M NOT...

...WEARING A DISGUISE.

HM, IF HE'S SQUIDWARD,
THEN YOU MUST BE... SANDY?

WHOOPS, WRONG OUTFIT.

[GASPING]

YOU'RE ME.

THEN I MUST BE...

PATRICK!

NAH, I'M JUST KIDDING.

I REALLY AM PATRICK.

[LAUGHING]

[LAUGHING]

GOOD ONE, PATRICK.

[LAUGHING]

THERE'S JUST ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

Man: BOAT SMARTS,
WITH MRS. PUFF.

THIS DRIVING SAFETY FILM
IS BROUGHT TO YOU
BY "COBBUTKSBSPOTRAOOBAT"

CITIZENS OF BIKINI BOTTOM UNITED
TO KEEP SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS

OFF THE ROAD AND OUT
OF BOATS ALL TOGETHER.

GOOD DAY, FUTURE MOTORISTS.

I'M MRS. PUFF, STATE ACCREDITED
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR.

TODAY, WE'LL BE DISCUSSING
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
A DRIVER WITH BOAT SMARTS...

RIPPING GOOD DAY FOR
A SPOT OF DRIVING.

...AND A DRIVER
WITHOUT BOAT SMARTS.

HEY, SQUIDWARD, LOOK WHAT
I CAN DO WITH MY FEET!

[GROANING]

LET'S SEE SOME EXAMPLES,
SHALL WE?

TIRE PRESSURE.

BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN THINK
ABOUT BOATING

THE BOATER WHO USES BOAT SMARTS
ALWAYS FILLS HIS TIRES
TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

WHILE THIS DRIVER PAYS
NO HEED TO BOAT SMARTS.

[GURGLING]

Mrs. Puff: BUCKLING UP.

AS DEMONSTRATED BY THIS DRIVER,
HE HAS ENOUGH BOAT SMARTS
TO USE HIS SEATBELT

AND AVOID A SERIOUS CASUALTY
AS A RESULT OF A COLLISION.

NOTICE HOW HE COMES GENTLY
TO A STOP SIGN.

NOW, THIS DRIVER
WITH NO REGARD FOR SAFETY...

[SCREAMING]

[SCREAMING]

Mrs. Puff: WELL, AT LEAST HE HAD
HIS SEAT BELT ON.

[SCREAMING]

Mrs. Puff: ADJUSTING
YOUR MIRRORS.

WHAT'S OUR BOAT SMARTS
BOATER UP TO NOW?

YOU GUESSED IT.

HE'S ADJUSTING HIS MIRROR
BEFORE HE BEGINS BOATING,
UNLIKE THIS DEGENERATE BOATER.

[SCREAMING]

AH, PERFECT.

HEY, USE YOUR MIRRORS, FOOL.

MIRRORS?

OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

I HAVEN'T ADJUSTED THIS ONE YET.

AH, CAN'T SEE.

OH!

[CHUCKLING]

[SCREAMING]

[CRASHING]

OW.

FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
A DRIVER WITH BOAT SMARTS

ALWAYS PAYS ATTENTION
TO HIS SURROUNDINGS,
AND AVOIDS DISTRACTIONS.

NOTICE HOW THIS DRIVER'S EYES
ARE LOCKED FIRMLY ON THE ROAD.

AND HERE WE HAVE THE EPITOME
OF A DRIVER

WHO IS CARELESSLY
DISTRACTING HIMSELF FROM
THE ROAD AND SAFETY.

[SPONGEBOB HUMMING]

[SPONGEBOB STAMMERING]

[HORNS HONKING]

[GROANING]

[SHRIEKING]

[GROANING]

JERK!

HI THERE!

HELP, LUNATIC DRIVER!

[SCREAMING...]

HOW'S IT GOING?

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

Mrs. Puff: SPONGEBOB, I MEAN,
A BOATER WITHOUT BOAT SMARTS

SHOWS CONTEMPT FOR
HIS BOATER BRETHREN AND THE LAW.

SpongeBob: LA, LALALALA,
LALALALA

WHEE!

HI, SQUIDWARD.

HI, MRS. PUFF.

[SCREAMING]

[GASPING]

[SCREAMING]

[HORN HONKING]

LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS
FORGOT YOUR BOAT SMARTS.

[LAUGHING]

Mrs. Puff: NEVER MIND.

[KRABS LAUGHING]

EXCITING MEETING, MR. KRABS?

OH, YOU BET YOU, SPONGEBOB.

LISTEN TO THIS.

INDIVIDUATION OF THE END USER
WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BROADEN

THE PROBABILITY OF MULTIPLE
SUBSEQUENT VISITS

GENERATING AN INVERSE
NEGATIVE REVENUE MARGIN

OF 3/4 OF
1/2 OF ONE PERCENT.

MEANING, IF YOU CALL
THE CUSTOMERS BY THEIR NAME

THEY KEEP COMING BACK TO SPEND
MORE OF THEIR GREENBACKS

SO I WANT YOU TWO TO LEARN
THE NAMES OF EVERY CUSTOMER.

I HAVE AN IMPORTANT LIFE
TO LIVE, AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE
CHATTERING WITH YOU TWO NINNIES.

I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT,
SO I DECIDED TO TURN THIS
INTO A CONTEST.

THE EMPLOYEE WHO LEARNS
MORE NAMES WINS THIS.

A TROPICAL GETAWAY,
ON THE TRIPLEDECKER CONHUGE CO.
CRUISE LINER.

SUNBATHING, PARCHEESI,

[LAUGHING]

THIS IS GONNA BE SO EASY.

SPONGEBOB DOESN'T REALIZE THAT
I'M THE FACE OF THE KRUSTY KRAB.

WHILE HE'S ISOLATED
IN THE KITCHEN ALL DAY

I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, BUILDING
A RAPPORT WITH THE CUSTOMER.

HELLO.

MAY I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE, MISS?

SINCE WHEN DO YOU GIVE
TWO SHRIMPS ABOUT
CUSTOMER SERVICE

MISTER GROUCHY SQUID GUY?

SpongeBob: HI, SALLY.

HI, SADIE.

HI, SHOOBIE.

HOW DOES SPONGEBOB
KNOW ALL THESE NAMES?

RIGHT BACK AT YOU, LENNY.

HEY, SPONGEBOB, COULD YOU TAKE
A LOOK AT THE CASH REGISTER?

I THINK IT'S BROKEN.

OH, SURE, SQUIDWARD.

I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED
A CLOSER LOOK.

LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND.

I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
IN HERE, SQUIDWARD.

KEEP LOOKING, SPONGEBOB.

KEEP ON LOOKING.

SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

HI, THADDEUS.

GOODBYE, SPONGEBOB.

THAT SHOULD BUY ME ENOUGH TIME
TO WIN THAT CRUISE.

GOOD DAY, YOUNG SIR.

MY NAME IS...

GUS!

HE'S RIGHT.

THIS GUY'S SO GOOD,
YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM A PRIZE.

HOW IN NEPTUNE'S CREATION
DO YOU KNOW ALL OF
THESE NAMES, SPONGEBOB?

WELL, I SIMPLY COMPILE THE NAME
OF EVERY CUSTOMER IN THIS BOOK.

THANKS, SPONGEBOB.

LET'S SEE.

HALPERT, NORMA, ISABELLE, GUS,
CHAZ, PILAR, DENNIS, KIRA,
IVY, MARV, MABLE, MAVIS.

[PANTING]

AND YOUR NAME
IS SUZY FISH, CORRECT?

YES, AND YOU'D ALSO BE CORRECT
IN SAYING YOU RUINED MY FOOD
WITH YOUR SWEAT, YOU NITWIT!

MR. KRABS,
THAT'S THE LAST CUSTOMER.

DO I WIN?

UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WASN'T KEEPING SCORE.

BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU
AND SPONGEBOB ARE NECK AND NECK

AND THAT MYSTERY GUY
OVER THERE'LL BE THE TIEBREAKER.

UH, THAT'S, UH...

OH, THAT'S, I KNOW HIM.

[BOTH STAMMERING]

HE'S THE TICKET TO YOUR PRIZE.

OUT OF THE WAY, LOSER.

UM, HELLO.

MY NAME IS SQUIDWARD.

UH, SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

UM, IT'S JUST THAT I WAS GOING
TO, UM, ENTER YOUR NAME
IN OUR SWEEPSTAKES.

SO, WHAT SHOULD I PUT DOWN?

FIRST AND LAST NAME?

SURE.

YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
WRITE THIS ON YOUR FORM.

WHAT'S IT TO YOU!

NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.

I SEE HE WANTS
TO PLAY HARD TO GET.

SO BE IT.

I HAVE WAYS OF MAKING
THE LIKES OF HIM TALK.

UH, SIR, YOU FORGOT YOUR SODA.

I DIDN'T ORDER ANY SODA.

IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

WHAT THE BARNACLES
ARE YOU DOING?

OH, I'M SORRY, I SLIPPED.

HERE, LET ME CLEAN
THAT UP FOR YOU.

OK, THERE MUST BE A NAMETAG
OR SOME FORM OF I.D. IN HERE.

I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

I'M OUT OF HERE.

[GROANING]

HEY, LOOK UP IN THE SKY.

A GIANT METEOR
IS HURTLING TOWARDS EARTH.

WHERE?

OH, YOU'LL SEE IT.

JUST KEEP LOOKING.

I CAN'T SEE IT.

WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD, 'CAUSE
I FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

[LAUGHING]

HEY, COME BACK HERE!

GIVE ME MY WALLET!

[LAUGHING]

[INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO]

HOLY SEA COW!

THAT HOOLIGAN RAN A STOP SIGN.

STOP, THIEF!

YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

HARDLY.

HE STOLE MY WALLET.

WHAT?

THAT MAKES HIM A DUAL OFFENDER.

LET'S GET HIM.

[LAUGHING]

[WHISTLE BLOWING]

[LAUGHING]

FINALLY, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

SAY GOODBYE
TO ANONYMITY, MISTER...

FREEZE, THIEF!

NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

I ONLY WANT THE WALLET FOR...

WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY
YOU WANT IT, WALLET SNATCHER.

[GROANING]

THIS ISN'T AS IT SEEMS!

THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE SAYING
IN THE SLAMMER, PUNK.

HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

[LAUGHING]

AT LAST, AT LAST!

AND YOUR NAME IS...

MR. "WHAT ZIT TOOYA?"

WHAT KIND OF RIDICULOUS
NAME IS THAT?

IT'S MY RIDICULOUS NAME.

"WHAT ZIT TOOYA."

[GROANING]

THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT BALLYHOO.

BUT I DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

TELL IT TO THE JUDGE,
LAW BREAKER.

[SQUIDWARD SIGHING]

ONLY 364 DAYS
AND NINE YEARS LEFT

UNTIL I EXCHANGE
THIS CONCRETE TOMB FOR A
MULTISTORY OCEAN LINER CRUISE.

SpongeBob: HEY, SQUIDWARD.

Squidward: SPONGEBOB.

THE BOY AND I JUST THOUGHT
WE'D STOP BY AND CHECK ON
OUR CONVICT FRIEND.

CALL ME WHAT YOU MAY.

FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
I FOUND OUT THE MYSTERY
CUSTOMER'S NAME FIRST, SO I WIN.

[LAUGHING]

I WIN, I WIN, I WIN,
I WIN, I WIN.

ENJOY YOUR PRIZE.

WHOOHOO!

TROPICAL VACATION, HERE I COME!

[LAUGHING]

VACATION?

WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT VACATION?

WHAT?

IN THE BROCHURE,
IT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS
AN OCEAN LINER VACATION.

OH, YOU MEAN THATBROCHURE?

WELL, THAT WAS THE PRIZE.

THE BROCHURE WAS TAKING UP
TOO MUCH ROOM IN ME DRAWERS,
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S YOUR PRIZE.

YOU MEAN, NO VACATION.

NOPE, JUST THE BROCHURE.

WELL, GOT TO GET BACK
TO COUNTING ME LOOT.

ENJOY YOUR NEW PRIZE, SQUIDWARD.

SEE YOU ON THE OUTSIDE

PATTIES, BUT DON'T COOK THEM.

I'LL HAVE TWO FROZEN
KRABBY PATTIES TOO.

YES, SIR.

I WANT PATTY SKATES.

Customer: I NEED TWO
PATTIES NOW.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

I'M SELLING TWICE
AS MANY PATTIES

AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO COOK 'EM.

THIS IS THE HAPPIEST
AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE DAY

OF ME WHOLE LIFE.

[CRYING]

Plankton: NO!

HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

I FREEZE HIS PLACE SOLID

AND HE TURNS IT
INTO AN ICE RINK.

HE'S MAKING MORE MONEY
THAN EVER.

Female voice: That's because,
unlike you

he's a good businessman.

WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE WIND
BENEATH MY WINGS.

I don't understand why
you don't just steal

a Krabby patty in all
that confusion.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

[LAUGHS]

[SIGHS] I don't know why
I encourage him.

[CROWD CHEERS]

Mr. Krabs:
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

OH, MY WEEKEND
WAS FABULOUS.

THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

PATRICK AND I WENT
JELLYFISHING BUT I LOST MY NET.

HA, SO I TRIED TO BORROW ONE
FROM SQUIDWARD BUT HE DIDN'T
HAVE ONE

AND THEN WHEN HE YELLED AT ME,
HE SWALLOWED A BUG.

[LAUGHS] SWALLOWED A BUG.

FASCINATING.

WELL, GOTTA GO.HEY.

YOU'RE BLOCKING THE EXIT.

[ALL GRUNTING]

[ENGINE DIES]

NO, NO!

[CRYING]

Mr. Krabs: I'LL TAKE THAT.

[LAUGHS] BRILLIANT IDEA TO BLOCK
THE EXIT WITH YOUR BODY,
SPONGEBOB.

UM, THANK YOU MR. KRABS.

[LAUGHS]

YOU LOSE AGAIN, PLANKTON.

I'M NOT GIVING UP YET, KRABS.

I'VE STILL GOT MY SECRET WEAPON.

THE THERMOSTAT! [LAUGHS]

THERMOSTAT?

THAT'S RIGHT, KRABS.

IT WAS I WHO FROZE
THE KRUSTY KRAB.

I'M SICK OF NOT
HAVING ANY BUSINESS.

Karen: THEN WHY DON'T YOU

LOOK AROUND.

CHIPPING PAINT, BAD PLUMBING,
DUST BUNNIES.

EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

I AM SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I'M HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE
WITH MY ABODE.

YOU SEE, [SNIFFLES], I WOULD
LIKE TO PAINT THE CHUM BUCKET

TO PLEASE MY WIFE, BUT ALAS,
I AM TOO SMALL AND FEEBLE.

OH, WELL, WE CAN HELP YOU.

RIGHT, PATRICK?

UHHUH.

I CAME PREPARED, TOO.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

OK, BOYS, KAREN WANTS THIS PLACE
TO REALLY SPARKLE.

I WAS THINKING IT COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE PIZZAZZ.

PIZZAZZ, YEAH.

HEY, I KNOW.

WHY DON'T YOU PAINT
THE ENTIRE CHUM BUCKET?

WHOA, REALLY?

OH, YES, I NEED
YOUR ARTISTIC VISION.

OH, HI, SQUIDWARD.

MR. PLANKTON'S HAVING US PAINT.

HE CALLS IT PIZZAZZ.

PIZZAZZ, HUH?

WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

PLANKTON SAYS HE NEEDS
OUR ARTISTIC VISION.

LET'S SHOW HIM.

[GRUNTING]

YOU BUFFOONS WOULDN'T KNOW
ARTISTIC VISION IF IT HIT YOU
OVER THE HEAD.

NOW, WHERE'S A PAINTBRUSH?

I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
ARTISTIC VISION IS ALL ABOUT.

START WITH LIGHT BRUSH STROKES.

OH.

YEAH, PERFECT.

SIMPLETONS.

AMAZING.

I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO TRICK
THE TALL ONE.

[LAUGHING]

MY PLAN IS FALLING
RIGHT INTO PLACE.

WITH THOSE THREE BOOBS
PREOCCUPIED, STEALING
THE FORMULA WILL BE A SNAP.

SpongeBob: MR. PLANKTON?

ALL THIS HARD WORK
IS MAKING US THIRSTY.

DO YOU THINK
WE COULD GET A DRINK?

LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING, SPONGEBOB.

I SURE WISH I COULD OFFER YOU
A COLD DRINK FOR ALL
YOUR HARD WORK

BUT ALAS, MY PIPES

DON'T YOU KNOW
A THING ABOUT ART?

GIVE ME THAT BRUSH.

[CHUCKLING]

YES, YES, AND YES.

VOILA.

A LOG CABIN?

YEAH, I JUST THINK
THEY'RE SO COZY.

NOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL ART.

EVERYONE'S A CRITIC.

I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
KRABS'S FACE WHEN HE DISCOVERS

THAT I'VE ABSCONDED WITH
THE SECRET KRABBY PATTY FORMULA.

SpongeBob: HEY, PLANKTON.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE NEW WINDOW?

WE GOT IT FROM THE KRUSTY KRAB.

SPONGEBOB, HOW DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO SEE OUT OF
A WINDOW THAT HIGH?

I GUESS I HADN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

Patrick: I DID.

LOOK, PLANKTON.

IT'S THE PERFECT HEIGHT
FOR YOUR KIND.

SEE, SPONGEBOB?

PATRICK'S USING THE OLD NOGGIN.

HE KNOWS I'LL ACTUALLY WANT
TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW.

WAIT, YOU WANTED
TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW?

WEIRD.

[GROWLING...]

UH...

CAN'T YOU TWO DO ANYTHING RIGHT?

I GIVE YOU ONE SIMPLE TASK
AFTER ANOTHER, AND...

JUST FORGET IT.

IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME TO THINK
THIS PLAN WOULD EVER WORK

WHEN NOTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE
HAS PANNED OUT.

TELEMARKETING, LIFEGUARDING,
CREATIVE WRITING,
ALL SUCH BITTER FAILURES.

[SOBBING]

OH, IT'S OK,
LITTLE, GREEN... CREATURE.

PATRICK AND I ARE GONNA
KEEP WORKING ON THE CHUM BUCKET

UNTIL IT'S
THE MOST "PIZZAZZIEST"
RESTAURANT IN BIKINI BOTTOM.

[SOBBING]

REALLY?

AND HOW.

COME ON, FELLOWS, LET'S DO
SOME INTERIOR DECORATING.

OH, GOODBYE, PAINTBRUSH.

WHERE COULD THAT STINGY CRAB BE?

HUPHUPHUPHUPHUPHUP.

STILL DON'T SEE HIM.

HUPHUPHUPHUPHUP.

[GASPING]

I'M IN THE CLEAR, BABY.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

NO, NO TEARS.

NOT YET.

THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.

[LAUGHING]

AT LONG LAST.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

AND THE SECRET FORMULA IS,
ONE BOTTLE OF MOLTING LOTION.

TAKE PASSPORT PHOTO.

GET NEW SAFE, TRAVEL SIZE.

THIS ISN'T THE SECRET FORMULA.

IT'S A TODO LIST.

[SCREAMING]

[GROWLING]

[SNORTING]

HUH?

WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE KRUSTY KRAB?

[GASPING]

WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE CHUM BUCKET?

[PLANKTON CRYING]

Plankton: CURSES.

THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT
BY RENOVATION.

I KNOW, ISN'T IT GREAT?

IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE KRUSTY KRAB.

Mr. Krabs: IT LOOKS MORE LIKE
PLANKTON TRYING TO STEAL
ME RESTAURANT.

MR. KRABS, YOU'VE RETURNED
FROM YOUR VACATION.

AND IT'S TIME FOR
THE KRUSTY KRAB TO RETURN
FROM ITSVACATION.

[GRUNTING]

HOORAY.

AND I BET YOU TRIED
TO STEAL THIS TOO.

[LAUGHING]

WELL, "STEAL" IS SUCH
A STRONG WORD.

[SCREAMING]

YOU DON'T REALLY THINK I'D LEAVE
ME SECRET FORMULA BEHIND
WHEN I GO ON VACATION, DO YOU?

NOW, STAY AWAY FROM ME...

...RESTAURANT, BUG.

I THINK WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

ALLOW ME TO DO THE HONORS.

[GRUNTING]

AHH...

OH, EXCELLENT JOB, GENIUS.

YOU REALLY FIXED THE PLACE UP.

DON'T NAG ME, KAREN.

I'VE HAD A LONG DAY.

YEP, SQUIDWARD,
YOU REALLY OUTDID YOURSELF
WITH THE NEW DECOR.

WHERE'D YOU GET THE FOUNTAIN?

THAT, I SCULPTED OUT OF
THE CONCRETE FOUNDATION
OF THE CHUM BUCKET.

AND ALL THESE METAL DECORATIONS?

THOSE WERE ALL FABRICATED
FROM THE CHUM BUCKET WALLS.

AND THE COMPUTER?

OH, THAT'S PLANKTON'S WIFE.

WELL, IT LOOKS GREAT, LAD,
AND IT DIDN'T COST ME A DIME.

WOW, $25 FOR A KRABBY PATTY?

RIPOFF, DUDE.

NOT COOL.

SHE'S RICH IN TASTE.

HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY DATE ANYONE?

I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

SPEAKING OF SOD...[INSECT BUZZING...]

WHY DON'T YOU GET RID
OF THIS GARBAGE?

IT'S STARTING TO
STINK UP THE JOINT.

DON'T SAY SUCH
A THING, SQUIDWARD.

PATTY'S JUST
A LITTLE SICK, IS ALL.

WIGHT, LUBBIEWUBBIE?

I'LL SHOW YOU SICK.

SQUIDWARD.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL PATTY?

BEAUTIFUL, HUH?

HOW BEAUTIFUL
DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

STOP IT, SQUIDWARD.

MAYBE YOU CAN'T
SEE PATTY'S BEAUTY

BUT TO ME SHE'S THE MOST
GORGEOUS CREATURE IN THE SEA.

WELL, I DEFINITELY SEE I CAN'T
HELP THE MENTALLY ATROPHIED.

GOODBYE, CREATURE.

PAY YOU NO MIND TO THAT,

[GASPS]

PATTY?

[SIZZLING]

AHH!

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN, BOY.

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
I WAS IN LOVE, TOO.

SHE WAS A KRABBY PATTY THAT
LOOKED A LOT LIKE YOURS DOES.

WELL, MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

SHE WAS A FIRM, JUICY,
A WARM PATTY.

AND ATTRACTIVEOH, SHE
LOOKED GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT.

SO... I DID.

DO YOU HEAR WHAT
I'M SAYIN' TO YOU, BOY?

UM, NOT QUITE, MR. KRABS.

KRABBY PATTIES ARE MEANT
TO BE LOVED AND EATEN.

THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
PUT IN THE OCEAN FOR.

AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOURS IS WAY PAST DUE.

I SEE NOW.

I SEE WHAT I MUST DO.

OH, PATTY, MY DARLING.

BEFORE I DO THIS

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I ONLY DO IT OUT OF LOVE.

DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

HAPPENS TO MY BRAIN
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU?

[GASP]: STORY TIME.

CAN I TELL IT
THIS TIME, SQUIDWARD?

PRETTY PLEASE?

WHENEVER SQUIDWARD SEES US

THE STORM CLOUDS IN HIS BRAIN
ROLL IN AND A NASTY STORM RAGES.

SO SQUIDWARD'S HAPPY GLAND
IS FORCED TO TAKE SHELTER

IN THE RECESSES OF HIS MIND.

BUT THE HAPPY GLAND
CAN'T FIND A RECESS DEEP ENOUGH

SO HE GETS THE FLU AND HAS TO
STAY IN BED UNTIL WE LEAVE.

AHCHOO.

AND THAT IS WHY I WILL NEVER,
FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE

AND THROUGHOUT ALL TIME
AND ETERNITY, EVER...

French Man: THREE HOURS LATER.

Squidward: AND WITH EVERY

DID SOMEONE JUST SAY "FREE"?

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

[SOBBING]: HE, HE...

AND THEN HE GAVE ME A FREE HAT.

MR. SQUIDWARD.

YES, SIR.

SQUIDWARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

MR. KRABS TOLD ME TO HELP YOU.

SO I MADE KRABBY PATTIES, SEE?

[TSK, TSK, TSK],
OH, THESE WILL NEVER DO.

BESIDES, IT TAKES
YEARS OF PRACTICE.

YOU'D NEVER BE UP TO IT, SORRY.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THOSE PATTIES?

OH, THESE ARE
NO GOOD, MR. KRABS.

SQUIDWARD MADE THEM.

THEY LOOK OK TO ME.

BUT HE'S NOT A REAL FRY COOK.

Mr. Krabs: YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT
BE AS GOOD A FRY COOK AS YOU.

THE MACHINE WANTED HIS 
JOB TO MAKE SPONGEBOB QUIT

AND SPONGEBOB DIDN'T LIKE IT.

NO, NOT ONE BIT.

PUSHING HIS GRILL, SPONGEBOB 
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.

I CHALLENGE YOUR GADGET.

I DECLARE PATTY WAR.

WITH THREE LITTLE WORDS, 
KRABS STARTED THE SHOW.

FLAG RAISED IN THE AIR, 
HE CRIED

READY, SET, GO...!

QUICK AS A FLASH, SQUIDWARD 
PULLED THE BIG LEVER.

THEN SAT BACK AND WATCHED, 
FEELING, OH, SO QUITE CLEVER.

SPONGEBOB WITH SPATULA 
HELD TIGHT IN HIS FIST,

FLUNG 20 PATTIES, 
NOT A SINGLE ONE MISSED.

THE CROWD WAS IMPRESSED.

WOW!

THEY CHEERED FULL OF GLEE.

ALL EXCEPT PATRICK, 
WHO HAD TO GO PEE.

A NOISE AND A CLATTER 
CAME FROM THE MACHINE.

AND OUT POPPED THE PATTIES 
IN A BURST OF HOT STEAM.

THE GADGET WAS FAST.

ITS FIRST BATCH COMPLETED.

BUT SPONGEBOB YELLED OUT

"I WON'T BE DEFEATED"!

HE TOOK IN SOME AIR.[INHALES]

SPONGEBOB SWELLED HIS PHYSIQUE.

THEN DOZENS OF PATTIES FILLED 
UP HIS CHEEKS.

HE STRAINED AND HE SWEATED.

HE SUMMONED HIS WILL.

AND SHOT KRABBY PATTIES, 
RIGHT ONTO THE GRILL.

"NOT BAD"

YELLED OUT SQUIDWARD.

A REALLY GOOD TRY.

BUT LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO
AGAINST MY MACHINE
SET ON HIGH.

THE GIZMO, IT SHUDDERED.

IT CLATTERED, IT SHOOK.

AND AS SQUIDWARD LAUGHED:HA, HA.

SANDY SAID:"WHAT A SCHNOOK".

BUT OL' SPONGEBOB CRIED OUT

"I WON'T LOSE TO THAT THING"!

THEN HE RAISED UP TWO 
SPATULAS

AND LEAPT LIKE A SPRING.

HIS HANDS WERE A BLUR, 
THE PATTIES WENT FLYING.

HE FRIED UP A HUNDRED 
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.

SQUIDWARD WAS WORRIED, 
SPONGEBOB COULDN'T BE BEAT.

I GOT ONE LAST CHANCE,
I'LL TURN UP THE HEAT.

HE STRUGGLED AND STRAINED

TILL HIS FACE TURNED DARK BLUE.

THEN THE LEVER MOVED FORWARD

AND BROKE RIGHT IN TWO.

THE GADGET BUCKLED AND SPARKED.

IT CRACKED LIKE A GUN.

SO SQUIDWARD TOOK OFF 
YELLING

"LET ME KNOW IF I'VE WON".

LIGHTNING FLEW FROM ITS MAW.

IT LOOKED READY TO BURST.

BUT SPONGEBOB, STILL 
STANDING, YELLED

"FOUL BEAST, DO YOUR WORST".

THE PATTIES CAME FLYING 
BY TWOS AND BY THREES.

BY DOZENS, BY HUNDREDS, 
OH, IT WAS SOMETHING TO SEE.

AYE, THAT MACHINE, IT WAS FAST.

BUT SPONGEBOB WAS FASTER.

HE'D PROVE TO THAT THING 
THAT HE WAS ITS MASTER.

THE GADGET BLEW INTO BITS 
AND DIED WITH A BOOM.

THE BLAST WAS SO LOUD

IT WOKE KING NEPTUNE.

[MUMBLES]: WHAT'S THAT?

IT WAS ALL OVER, 
FINISHED AND DONE.

WITH HIS HEAD 
HELD UP HIGH

SPONGEBOB KNEW HE HAD WON.PHEW.

THE CROWD YELLED, "HOORAY

SQUIDWARD'S NAME IS NOW MUD"!

BUT AS THEY WERE CHEERING

SPONGEBOB FELL WITH A THUD.

SpongeBob: UNH.[GASP]

THE SERVICE WAS SHORT.

TEARS SHED WITH REGRET.[SNIFFS]

SQUIDWARD, IT SEEMED, WAS 
THE ONE MOST UPSET.

[CRYING]

WHOO, YEAH!

WHAT'S THAT?

YOU THOUGHT SPONGEBOB WAS 
BURIED DOWN THERE?

THEY JUST BURIED THE GADGET

HAHA, THIS I SWEAR.

WELL, THAT ENDS ME TALE, 
STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK.

NOW I GOT TO GO 
AND POLISH ME HOOK.

[♪...]

WELL, SQUIDWARD, OL' BOY

ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO GO WIN
THAT DANCING TROPHY

AND GIVE IT A HOME.

AFTER ALL, NOBODY EVER WORKED
HARDER TO GET IT THAN YOU.

[♪...]

ALL THOSE YEARS OF TRAINING
WITH THE MASTERS.

YOUR TIRELESS EFFORT TO KEEP
YOUR INSTRUMENT SUPPLE.

NOT TO MENTION YOUR WEEKLY
THIGH WAXING.

AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO GO GET IT.

SO, LET'S DO IT.

WHOO...!

[CRASH]

TSK, TSK, TSK, TSK.

WANT TO GIVE ME A RULING,
SPONGEBOB?

SORRY, SQUIDWARD,
YOU GOT TO GO LOWER TO WIN.

WHAT?

WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

WE'RE LIMBO DANCING

TO GET READY FOR THE
DANCEATHON AUDITIONS.

WE'RE GONNA WIN THE TROPHY.

HA, THE TWO OF YOU?

DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

COME HERE...
SEE THAT?

THAT'S WHERE
THE TROPHY'S GOING.

OOH...

YOU BUILT US A TROPHY CASE
FOR WHEN WE WIN?

OH, YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND.

NO, YOU TWITS.

I BUILT THAT TROPHY CASE
FOR ME WHEN IWIN.

I'M GOING TO ACE
THE TRYOUTS TODAY

AND THEN I'M GOING
TO THE FINALS TOMORROW

AND WIN THE TROPHY.

I AM GOING FORTH TO MEET
MY DESTINY.

GOODBYE.

[CRASH]

RULING, SPONGEBOB?

I THINK WE BETTER
RAISE THE BAR.

[♪...]

HIYA, SQUIDWARD.

OH, GREAT.

THE FLYING GAVONNE BROTHERS.

JUST IGNORE THEM, SQUIDWARD.

Female: [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]:
CONTESTANTS 51 AND 52
TO THE STAGE, PLEASE.

WE'RE UP, PATRICK.

WISH US LUCK, SQUIDWARD.

DO I KNOW YOU?

[LAUGHS] YOU KIDDER.

LET'S GO, PATRICK.

POOR BOOBS, THEY DON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

[LAUGHS]

WELL, SEE YOU AT THE FINALS,
SQUIDWARD.

YOU ACTUALLY GOT IN?

YEP.

HUMPH, IF THOSE TWO
NITWITS MADE IT

THEN I'M A SHOOIN.

Female: [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]:

Male Judge: NEXT.

EXCUSE ME?

YOU'RE DONE.

YOU KNOW, NEXT CONTESTANT.

YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT,
SORRY, MAC.

BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

I, I, I ALREADY BUILT
A TROPHY CASE

WITH THE CUTEST LITTLE PLAQUE.

IF I COULD JUST, JUST,
JUST TOUCH IT.HEY!

Squidward: BUT I, HEY...[PUNCHING]

UNHAND ME, YOU BRUTES.

AH!

[CRYING]

[CRASH]

SPONGEBOB?

YOU'RE JUST NOT GETTING
INTO THE SPIRIT OF THIS
THING, SQUIDWARD.

DOH, HELP ME UP.

HOW'D THE AUDITION GO,
SQUIDWARD?

THE AUDITION?

MY TROPHY?

[SOBBING]

I MEAN, UH, UH...

YEAH, THE AUDITION.

[CHUCKLES] EVIDENTLY,
I'M SUCH A GREAT DANCER

THAT I'VE BEEN BANNED FROM
THE COMPETITION FOR LIFE.

WHOA.IMPRESSIVE.

[GASPS] HEY, SQUIDWARD.

WOULD YOU BE OUR COACH
FOR THE FINALS?

WHAT?

I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN HELP YOU TWO DOPES.

LIKE POLISHING YOUR EMPTY
TROPHY CASE?

FINE.

BUT I KEEP THE TROPHY
WHEN WE WIN, DEAL?

DEAL.

OK.

SHOW ME WHAT YOU
GOT, PATRICK.

OK, HERE I GO.

WATCH ME NOW.

OOH, CRAMP!

[SCREAMING]

WELL, I GUESS THAT
JUST LEAVES YOU, SPONGEBOB.

SHOW ME YOUR STUFF.

READY, AND...

[LAUGHING]

HAVING FUN?

YES, YES, I AM.

SPONGEBOB, DANCING ISN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ART

AND ART IS SUFFERING!

NOW, WE'LL START
WITH SOME BALLET.

WATCH MY FEET
AND FOLLOW MY LEAD.

READY, AND PLIE.

RELEVE.

AND NOW, GRAND JETE

AHH...

NO, NO, NO.

THIS WILL

YOU'VE GOT TWO LEFT FEET.

SpongeBob: HOW'D YOU KNOW?

Squidward: GIVE ME THOSE.

UNH...

[SIGHS] THAT'S BETTER.

OK, LET'S GO.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHY ARE YOU MOVING YOUR
ARMS LIKE THAT?

[LAUGHS] I GUESS
THEY'RE HAPPY.

Squidward: ARGH, HAND 'EM OVER.

AND THE OTHER ONE, COME ON.

UNH...

[SIGHS] NOW, THAT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

GEE, SQUIDWARD, WITH YOUR ARMS
AND LEGS DOING ALL THE WORK

I'M NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING.

I THINK I SHOULD HELP.

ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY LEADERSHIP?

WELL, I JUST...

OK, HAND IT OVER.

YOU KNOW WHAT, SQUIDWARD?

WHAT?

I THINK I'M SUFFERING
FOR MY ART NOW.

THESE LOSERS ARE HERE
TO WORSHIP US.

I MEAN ME.

BY THE END OF THE NIGHT

I'LL HAVE THEM
ON THEIR KNEES

JUST BEGGING FOR MORE.

Female: [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]: Now
that's what I like to call

a hard act to follow.

Next up, we have SpongeBob
SquarePants.

[CHEERING]

OH, MAN.

I CAN'T WAIT.

I AM SOSTOKED
ON DANCING RIGHT NOW.

NOW BEFORE I BEGIN

LET ME JUST THANK YOU ALL FOR
COMING OUT TONIGHT.

[MUFFLED SOUNDS]

WILL YOU PLEASE STOP IT?

AND LET MY DANCING

[♪...]

[CHEERING]

[CHEERING FADES]

WOW, SQUIDWARD, THE CROWD'S
GONE SILENT.

OF COURSE THEY HAVE.

THEY ARE IN THE PRESENCE
OF A TRUE ARTISTE.

[CHATTERING]

WHAT'S HE DOING?

IS HE HURT?

I DON'T KNOW, MAN, BUT
IT'S HURTING MY EYES.

I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.

[VOMITS]

UH, SQUIDWARD?

HA, IF THEY THINK THAT'S GOOD

WAIT TILL THEY SEE...

[GRUNTING]

[SCREAMING]

[CHEERING]

BY UNANIMOUS DECISION,
WE HAVE A WINNER.

[GASPS] MINE!

I WON, I WON!

NEVER BEFORE HAVE
I SEEN SUCH ZEST

SUCH JOIE DE VIVRE.

OH, THANK YOU,
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT A VERY SPECIAL SOMEONE.

WAIT, SPONGEBOB, NO!

[GRUNTS]

THE RULEBOOK CLEARLY STATES

"A SINGLE DANCER MUST
PERFORM

WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE
FROM A PARTNER."

THEREFORE, YOU'RE THE WINNER.

OH MAN, THE JIG'S UP, PEDRO.

WE'RE GOIN' HOME.

[GASPING]

IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO CALL A TAXI.

MERCIFUL NEPTUNE.

ARE THERE ANY MORE CHEATERS?

OH, CRUD, WE'RE TWO DANCERS.

WE'RE NINE DANCERS ACTUALLY.

DOES THIS COUNT?

ISN'T THERE
A SINGLE DANCER HERE

WHO IS NOT ASSISTED
BY A PARTNER?

UH, WHAT ABOUT NUMBER 52
OVER THERE?

[SCREAMING]

IS HE ALONE?

Patrick: [MUFFLED SCREAM]WELL, LET ME SEE.

WHY, YES,
HE IS A SINGLE DANCER.

OH, WELL, THEN.

[SCREAMING]

I GUESS HE WINS.

[SCREAMING]

[REGISTER RINGS]SPONGEBOB, ORDER UP.

[SIGHS]

WELCOME TO THE KRUSTY...

SPONGEBOB, WHAT IN NEPTUNE'S...

SPONGEBOB?

WELL, HIS SPATULA'S STILL WARM.

WELL, SPONGEBOB...

I MUST ADMIT
THIS IS STRANGE BEHAVIOR...

EVEN FOR YOU.

AHOY, SQUIDWARD.

GOOD NEPTUNE.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, SON?

I THINK HE'S IN SOME KIND
OF SELFINDUCED TRANCE.

NO, SQUIDWARD,
THIS IS WORSE.

HE'S GOT THE
THOUSANDYARD STARE.

I HAD IT ONCE MESELF,
BACK IN ME SERVICE DAYS.

WHAT IS IT LAD?

QUICK, WE'RE LOSIN' MONEY.

IT'S THE BOY'S TINY CALENDAR.

AND HE'S CIRCLED TODAY'S DATE.

"IMPORTANT FOOD CRITIC
VISITS KRUSTY KRAB?"

THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING ALL THIS?

ONLY A COMPLETE MORON
WOULD WORRY ABOUT WHAT
SOME CRITIC HAS TO SAY.

[QUIVERING]

I REST MY CASE.

[DOOR OPENS]

[SNIFFING]

HEY, IN OUR OUT, MISTER.

YOU'RE LETTING OUT THE A.C.

WEIRDO.

WHY HELLO.

YOU'RE THE TELEVISION FOOD
CRITIC GENE SCALLOP, AREN'T YA?

ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

I'M EUGENE KRABS, OWNER AND
PROPRIETOR OF THIS FINE...

WELL, DO YOU WANNA ORDER
SOMETHING OR DO YOU JUST
WANNA BLOCK MY READING LIGHT?

SQUIDWARD, YOU JUST
DROVE AWAY GENE SCALLOP!

DON'T YOU KNOW OUR LIVES
DEPEND ON HIS REVIEW?

MR. KRABS, THE ONLY THING
MY LIFE DEPENDS ON

IS GOING HOME AT 6:00.

M... MR. SCALLOP,
WAIT, PLEASE.

BEFORE YOU GO,
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

TRY ONE OF OUR DELICIOUS
KRABBY PATTIES.

IT'S ABSOLUTELY FFF...

[MUTTERING]

COMPLIMENTARY.

O.K., SPONGEBOB,
THAT'LL BE ALL.

HE'S NOBODY.

[LOUD GULP]

WE'RE DOOMED.

And there were no survivors.

Thank you, Barbara.

Thank you, Bob.

SHE IS SO TACKY.

Bob: And now it's time
for "Bottom Feeding"
with Gene Scallop.

TURN IT UP, SQUIDWARD.

Thank you, Bob.

This week, I visited...

Bob: You're
welcome, Gene.

[Clears throat]

This week I reviewed
the Krusty Krab restaurant

a local burger joint
that's second to none.

Or should I say second to "run"

since this critic wanted to make
like a banana and peel out

the minute he saw how drab
this Krab really was.

That bad, huh Gene?

Barbara, once I stuck my beak
through that door

my appetite flew south
for the winter.

I mean, I'm not "kidding"
when I say this restaurant

smells like the
rear end of a goat.

[LAUGHING]

And how was the service, Gene?

You could find livelier help
in a graveyard

and I'm not just "coffin."

The management stunk so bad

I had to get my sweater
dry cleaned on the way home

with me in it.

[CUSTOMERS MURMURING]

Krab: HEY, NO, WAIT, WAIT!

However, at the end of my visit

I chowed down on a meal that
titillated my taste buds

and gratified my gullet.

That Sponge behind the grill
is no square

when it comes to cooking!

[EXCITED TALKING]

If Krabs really wanted
to soak up the dough

He'd Sponge it up.

He'd Sponge it out,
he'd overSponge it.

You can never have
too much Sponge.

Well, back to work.

AY, AYAYAYAY...

THAT'S ME BOY, SPONGEBOB!

THAT'S ME BOY.

[CASH REGISTER RINGS]

TRALALA, LALALALA

WOW...

Krab: O.K.,
A LITTLE LOWER, LOWER...

THAT'S PERFECT.

GOOD MORNING, SIR,
WHAT'S WITH THE NEW SIGN?

OH, JUST MAKIN'
A FEW COSMETIC CHANGES.

OH, YOU MEAN, LIKE WHEN
SQUIDWARD HAD THAT MOLE
TAKEN OFF HIS...

EH, WELL, YEAH,
A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT.

MORNING, SQUIDWARD!

OOH.

SQUIDWARD, WHERE DID
YOU FIND THOSE SHOES?

[SQUIDWARD HISSING]

Child: LOOK, IT'S HIM.

MR. SQUAREPANTS?

CAN I HAVE
YOUR AUTOGRAPH?NO.

BUT, WHY?

WELL, THE FIRST REASON IS

I HAVE NO USE
OF MY ARMS, SEE?

OW!

HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE?

HE HIT ME...

JUST 'CAUSE I WANTED
HIS AUTOGRAPH.

SQUIDWARD.

I'M SORRY, LITTLE GIRL.

OF COURSE YOU CAN
HAVE HIS AUTOGRAPH...

FOR FIVE BUCKS.

WHAT A RIP.

LOOK AT THESE, SQUIDWARD,
HEH, HEH, HEH.

LOOKS LIKE SOME
SORT OF HORRIFIC SHROUD.

THEY'RE OUR NEW
KRUSTY SPONGE NAPKINS.

EXTRA ABSORBENT...
[LAUGHING]

YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.

OH, THAT REMINDS ME, SQUIDWARD.

I NEED YOU TO
UNPACK THESE BOXES.

WHAT'S IN THEM?CONDIMENTS.

SQUIDWARD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

SCRAMBLIN' MY BRAINS.

WE'LL MAKE 'EM $2.98.

[WHISTLE BLOWS]

[EXHAUSTED SIGH]

ALL ABOARD.

UNLESS I DON'T WANT IT.

MMHM...

SPONGEBOB...

WHAT DO ALL THESE WORDS SAY?

IT'S AN AD.

SpongeBob as Announcer: 
DEAR COMIC BOOK READER.

THAT'S ME!

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT 
TURNING ONE OF YOUR POEMS INTO 
A SONG ON THE RADIO?

I'VE NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING.

SEND IN YOUR POEM AND $100 
AND WE'LL MAKE IT A HIT.

CAN WE GO NOW?
MY ARMS ARE GETTING TIRED.

I WANNA SEND IN A POEM

AND EVERYONE WOULD LOVE IT,
AND I WOULD BE A STAR.

YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TRUST ADS
IN COMIC BOOKS.

THOSE XRAY SPECS I ORDERED
COULDN'T SEE THROUGH PEOPLE'S
SKIN AT ALL...

ONLY THEIR CLOTHES,

PLUS, YOU DON'T HAVE $100.

UH, PATRICK,
COULD YOU GET MY WALLET?

HEY, LOOK,
I JUST FOUND $100.

IT'S A SIGN THAT
I SHOULD MAKE MY HIT RECORD.

HEY, THAT'S MY
COMIC BOOK MONEY.

IT'S A SIGN...

A SIGN THAT FELL FROM
THE BACK OF YOUR PANTS.

I'VE LEARNED TO TRUST
SIGNS LIKE THAT.

PATRICK?

HEY, YOU GONNA PAY
FOR THOSE COMICS?

NO.

OH, CAN I HAVE MY ARMS BACK?

Patrick: I WISH NOT TO BE
DISTURBED, SPONGEBOB

FOR I AM ABOUT TO ERUPT
WITH A MASTERPIECE.

GOOD LUCK.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

COMING... OH!SPONGEBOB.

COULD I BORROW A PENCIL AND
SOME PAPER AND A PLACE TO WORK?

SPONGEBOB,
THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN.

WHY WON'T IT MAKE WORDS?

YOU HAVE TO THINK
OF THE WORDS YOURSELF.

I THINK I WROTE A POEM ONCE.

A POEM BY PATRICK STAR.

ROSES ARE BLUE.

VIOLETS ARE RED.

I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

HEY, BUDDY.

PATRICK, A LITTLE PRIVACY?

OH, SORRY, SPONGEBOB.

I JUST CAME OVER
TO BORROW SOME JELLY.

WELL, GO AHEAD...

BUT I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO PLAY RIGHT NOW.

I AM LATE FOR PICTURE DAY

AND I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO GET TO SCHOOL

WITHOUT BEING COVERED
BY UNSIGHTLY DEBRIS.

IF ONLY I HAD
A SEALED BARRIER

TO PROTECT ME FROM THE
FILTH OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

I HAVE THE SOLUTION.

[SLURPING]

EW.

[SIGHS]

I HAVE SOLVED
MY HUNGER PROBLEM.

THAT'S IT!

THIS JELLY JAR WILL INSULATE ME

FROM THE DIRTY DREGS
OF BIKINI BOTTOM.

IF YOU DON'T MIND, PATRICK,
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

[GRUNTING]

[PATRICK PANTING]

WE'RE HERE.

HEY, WHY'D I BRING JELLY FOR?

UH, PATRICK...

OH, YEAH.

I WAS GONNA PUT IT
ON THIS PEANUT BUTTER TACO.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, PATRICK!

I'M NOT JELLY,
I'M NOT JELLY!

[GASPING]

SPONGEBOB, GET OUT OF MY TACO.

[GROANING]

[SOBBING]

WHAT'S THE MATTER, SPONGEBOB?

PATRICK, I JUST WANT
TO TAKE A DECENT PICTURE TODAY

BECAUSE SOMEDAY, I WILL
GRADUATE FROM BOATING SCHOOL

AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE GUY

COVERED IN PEANUT BUTTER

AND TACO SHELLS [SOBBING].

[SOBBING]THERE YOU ARE.

SAY CHEESE.

AND HERE'S THE LAST ONE.

NOW, JUST GIVE A NICE SMILE
TO THE CAMERA, SPONGEBOB.

WAIT, CAN I GO HOME
AND CHANGE FIRST?

NO TIME.

SAY CHEESE.

[SOBBING]: CHEESE, CHEESE,
CHEESE, CHEESE.

QUIT THAT MOODY BROODING.

THIS WILL CLEAN YOU UP.

[WHIMPERING]

DON'T SNIVEL LIKE THAT.

A WINNER DOESN'T SNIVEL.

TRY PUTTING THIS ON.

[MUTTERING]

THIS IS IT.

NOW YOU ARE LOOKING
LIKE A WINNER.

[SOBBING]

SPONGEBOB, PLEASE STOP CRYING

SO HE CAN TAKE THE PICTURE.

DO NOT WORRY, MRS. PUFF.

I BROUGHT PEARLIE.

I CAN'T STOP CRYING.

THIS WILL MAKE YOU SMILE...

JA, WHETHER YOU
WANT TO OR NOT.

NOW, SAY CHEESE.

CHEESE.

[CAMERA SNAPPING]

THERE I AM.

HEY, I DON'T LOOK
SO BAD AFTER ALL.

[♪...]

Krabs: YEESH, WE NEED
SOME CUSTOMERS IN HERE.

[GROANING]

WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

OH, I DON'T KNOW.

WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN.

YES, I'VE SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE.

IT'S A COMMON SYMPTOM.

PATRICK IS SUFFERING
FROM KRABBY PATTY WITHDRAWAL.

HE NEEDS ONE

OR HE'LL KEEP MUMBLING ABOUT IT
FOR THE NEXT 31/2 MINUTES.

OOH, HE NEEDS ONE, EH?

METHINKS A PAYING CUSTOMER'S
IN OUR MIDST.

PATRICK, HOW'S A KRABBY PATTY
WITH EXTRA CHEESE SOUND?

[GASPING]

GIVE ME!

FIRST, I HAVE TO KNOW.

CAN YOU PAY FOR IT?

OH, YEAH, I CAN PAY FOR IT.

GOOD BOY.

[SIGHING]

Narrator: 10 SECONDS LATER.

[SNORING]

MY GOOD MAN, HOW YOU DOING?

[MUMBLING]

GOOD.
EXCELLENT.

NOW, LET'S GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS.

WHAT'S THAT?

IT'S YOUR BILL.

I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

WHAT?

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULD PAY FOR IT.

OH, I'M PAYING FOR IT,
ALL RIGHT.

[BELCHING]

NONPAYING CUSTOMER!

[ALARM BLARING]

HUH?

YOU'RE GONNA PAY,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

ALL RIGHT, PATRICK...

IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA PAY
FOR YOUR FOOD WITH MONEY

YOU'RE GONNA PAY
WITH HARD, PHYSICAL LABOR.

I WANT YOU TO SWAB THE LATRINE.

I'LL BE BACK IN A WHILE
TO CHECK UP ON YOU.

[MUMBLING]:
BOTTOMFEEDING IMBECILES.

NO PROBLEM.

TRALALALALA

WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK

SO, PATRICK, HOW ARE YOU...

[GASPING]

WHAT IN BLAZES DID YOU DO?

I ACCIDENTALLY TRIED
THE HAND SOAP.

[BELCHING]

IT DOESN'T TASTE
AS GOOD AS IT SMELLS.

[KRABS MUTTERING]

SEE THESE ICE CUBE TRAYS?

I WANT YOU TO PUT 'EM
IN THAT BUCKET.

HOW DO I DO IT?

FIGURE IT OUT.

UH...

I HAVE TO BE VERY GENTLE.

[GRUNTING]

WHAT THE...

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

ALMOST DONE, MR. KRABS.

YOU'VE DESTROYED
ME REFRIGERATOR.

YOU'VE DESTROYED MANY OF
THE THINGS I LOVE.

I GOT ANOTHER JOB THAT EVEN

A NIMROD LIKE YOU
COULDN'T MESS UP.

ALL'S YOU GOTTA DO

IS THROW
ALL OF THESE TRASH BAGS

DOWN THE TRASH CHUTE, LIKE SO.

SEE?

YUP.GOOD.

BECAUSE IF YOU MESS THISUP

YOU'LL NEVER EAT
ANOTHER KRABBY PATTY AGAIN.

[SCREAMING]

HURRY, HURRY, HURRY!

HERE, BOY, TAKE THIS SACK
OF LOOT AND PUT HER IN ME SAFE.

OKEYDOKEY, MR. KRABS.

[WHISTLING]

[CRASHING]HUH?

HURRY, HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

[GRUNTING]

SpongeBob: PATRICK?

WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

I HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS TRASH

BUT IT WON'T GO DOWN.

[LAUGHING]

THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HIT
THE TRASH COMPACTOR SWITCH.

[MACHINE RUMBLING]

[GASPING]

SPONGEBOB, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

OH, NO, THERE'S ONE LEFT.

PATRICK, THAT'S NOT A...
TRASH BAG.

NO!

WHY WON'T YOU GO DOWN?

WELL, WELL, LET'S SEE HOW
THE POOR BOY'S DOING.

WELL, DID YOU EARN ME
MONEY BACK YET, PATRICK?

[EXPLOSION]

CAN I EAT NOW?

[♪...]

[MEOWING]

THANK YOU, MR. POSTMAN.

THANKS, GARY.

HM, CAN'T READ
THE RETURN ADDRESS.

MAYBE THIS'LL SHED SOME LIGHT.

"HEY, SPONGEBOB.

IT'S YOUR COUSIN, BLACKJACK.

GUESS WHAT?

I'M OUT OF PRISON AND DECIDED
TO PAY YOUR PARENTS A VISIT.

IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM AGAIN

MEET ME FOR A WRESTLING MATCH
AT THEIR HOUSE.

TRY IT, LITTLE MAN...
BLACKJACK."

COUSIN BLACKJACK'S
OUT OF PRISON?

[MEOWING]

THAT'S RIGHT, GARY.

THECOUSIN BLACKJACK.

THE SAME COUSIN BLACKJACK

THAT USED TO BEAT ME UP
ALL THE TIME WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

[GROANING]

[LAUGHING]

COME ON, LITTLE MAN.

LET'S GO A COUPLE OF ROUNDS,
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH.

WHY SHOULD WE?

BECAUSE IT'LL SHOW...

WHAT A LITTLE MAN YOU ARE.

[SCREAMING]

OH, NO.

THAT WAS YEARS AGO, GARY.

[MEOWING]

MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

JUST IMAGINE WHAT
HE MUST LOOK LIKE NOW.

HI, SPONGEBOB.

IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

GOOD TO SEE YOU'RE STILL...

A LITTLE MAN.

[LAUGHING]

[LAUGHING]

NO!

THAT BRUTE HAS MY PARENTS.

I GOTTA GET OVER THERE.

GARY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I'LL BE GONE.

I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER COME BACK.

[MEOWING]

I MAY GET BEATEN
TO A QUIVERING PULP

BUT I MUST DO IT,
FOR THE SAKE OF MY PARENTS.

[PANTING]

OH, MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE?

WHAT'S THIS?

"DO NOT CROSS."

IS THAT POLICE TAPE?

THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON
FOR THE POLICE BEING HERE:

A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.

NO!

GET IT TOGETHER, SQUAREPANTS.

TO FACE BLACKJACK, YOU'VE
GOTTA BE AS TOUGH AS NAILS.

[INHALES]

[GRUNTING]

HUH? WHAT?

ALL THE FURNITURE
IS COVERED IN PLASTIC.

THE POLICE MUST
HAVE COVERED EVERYTHING
TO PRESERVE THE CRIME SCENE.

WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED HERE?

WHAT'S THIS?

BLACKJACK SMASHED
MY FAMILY PORTRAIT.

OH, NO.

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
WITH MY PARENTS?

[CROWD CHEERING ON TELEVISION]

OH, DARLING, IT'S SO NICE
TO SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH YOU

WHAT WITH YOU IN THE OFFICE
ALL HOURS OF THE DAY.

[SNORING]

[LOUD POUNDING]

[GASPING]

[LAUGHING]

I GOT A NEW OUTFIT FOR YOU.

[LAUGHING]

[WHIMPERING]

FIEND.

WHERE DID HE TAKE THEM?

I MUST FIND MORE EVIDENCE.

WHAT'S THIS?

ANOTHER NOTE?

"SPONGEBOB, I PAID
YOUR PARENTS A VISIT.

NOW, I'M GONNA DO
THE SAME WITH GRANDMA.

YOU BETTER HURRY,
LITTLE MANBOY...

BLACKJACK."

HE'S GONNA GET GRANDMA TOO.

I HAVE TO STOP HIM.

[PANTING]

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA, WHERE ARE YOU?

ARE YOU OK?

GRANDMA, YOU IN HERE?

GRANDMA?

OH, NO, I'M TOO LATE.

HE BURNT YOU TO A CRISP.

OH, THAT ANIMAL.

[SOBBING]

Grandma: SPONGEBOB?

GRANDMA?

ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
FROM BEYOND THE BEYOND?

Grandma: WELL, IF YOU MEAN FROM
BEYOND THE KITCHEN TABLE, YES.

YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

I'VE BAKED A FRESH BATCH
OF GINGERBREAD MEN.

BUT WHERE'S BLACKJACK?

OH, BLACKJACK JUST CALLED
AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

HE COULDN'T MAKE IT

BECAUSE HE'S GOT
SOME LOOSE ENDS TO TIE UP.

LOOSE ENDS?

MY PARENTS!

HE'S TIED THEM UP?

AND IF YOU DON'T HURRY,
YOU'LL MISS OUT

ON ALL THE FUN.

[LAUGHING]

[SCREAMING]

AND WHEN IT'S ALL DONE

HE'LL NEED HELP
CLEANING UP THE MESS.

CLEANING UP THE MESS?

I GOTTA GET HELP.

I'LL GO TO UNCLE CAP'N BLUE'S.

HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

[PANTING]

[GASPING]

UNCLE CAP'N BLUE,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

WELL, IF IT ISN'T
LITTLE SPONGEBOB.

PLANT A FIRM ONE ON ME, BOBBY.

[LAWN MOWER RUNNING...]

I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
RESCUE MY PARENTS.

SURE, LITTLE BOBBY.

I COULD USE SOME
HELP WITH THE LAWN

BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS
TO DO THE JOB RIGHT.

[PANTING]

Narrator: 346 MINUTES LATER.

[PANTING]

UNCLE CAP'N BLUE...[LOUD BLENDER MOTOR]

I NEED TO HELP MY PARENTS.

THEY'RE IN DANGER.

WHAT, YOU WANNA
BUILD A FENCE?

[LAUGHING]

THE BOY CAME TO WORK.

ACTUALLY, I CAME
TO TRY TO FIND MY...

I'VE MADE A TOMATO AND CLAM
JUICE SMOOTHIE TO REFRESH YOU.

WELL, OF COURSE YOU CAN.

[PANTING...]

[GROANING]

[LAUGHING]

LANDSCAPING?

ISN'T IT A LITTLE DARK OUT
FOR LANDSCAPING?

[MUSIC ENDS]

LISTEN, UNCLE CAP'N BLUE.

WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

COUSIN BLACKJACK HAS MY PARENTS
HELD CAPTIVE AT HIS HOUSE.

THEY LET THAT DANGEROUS
MISCREANT OUT OF PRISON?

SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PARENTS
ARE IN TROUBLE, KID.

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO RESCUE THEM NOW!

WHOA THERE, LITTLE BOBBY.

NO CAN DO.

BUT UNCLE CAP'N BLUE,
I NEED THE HELP OF
A CRIMEFIGHTER LIKE YOU.

NO, NO, I DON'T CHASE
CRIMINALS THESE DAYS.

I'M RETIRED, AND IF I WERE YOU

I'D CONSIDER TURNING
AROUND AND GOING HOME.

YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS KIND OF WORK, BOY.

AN INNOCENT KID LIKE YOU
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST A CRIMINAL MIND.

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

WHAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT
DO TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

YOU MEAN THEY WON'T GIVE ME
A PUSH ON THE SWING SET?

WELL, LET'S JUST SAY,
I HOPE YOU'VE PRACTICED

WALKING WITHOUT LEGS...

OR ARMS OR A BODY.

BUT SINCE YOU INSIST

I'LL DRIVE YOU
ALL THE WAY OVER
TO BLACKJACK'S RIGHT NOW.

JUST TRY TO RELAX
UNTIL WE GET THERE.

THERE IT IS, WE'RE HERE.

UH, LOCK THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU, KID.

[GROWLING]

[BARKING]

OHH!

NICE WORMY, NICE WORMY.

NICE WORMY.[BARKING CONTINUES]

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

WHAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT
DO TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

[SCREAMING]

UNCLE CAP'N BLUE IS RIGHT.

I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS.

I SHOULD JUST TURN AROUND
AND GO HOME.

[MRS. SQUAREPANTS SCREAMING]

MOTHER!

[PANTING]

MOM!

Mrs. Squarepants: HELP ME!

THEY'RE TRAPPED
IN THE BASEMENT.

MOM, DAD, QUICK!

LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

OH, BUT IF WE LEAVE NOW,
WE'LL MISS THE PARTY.

PARTY?

OH, WHY, YES.

WE'RE CELEBRATING
YOUR COUSIN BLACKJACK'S

RELEASE FROM PRISON.

NOW IF YOUR KLUTZY MOTHER CAN
STOP DROPPING HER PUNCH GLASS

LIKE SHE DROPPED
THAT PICTURE FRAME...

I TOLD YOU, HAROLD,
THAT WAS THE FUMIGATOR'S FAULT.

THE FUMIGATOR'S?

SO THAT WASN'T A CRIME SCENE
I SAW AT YOUR HOUSE.

THE ONLY CRIME THAT EVER
HAPPENED AT OUR HOUSE

WAS THE INFESTATION
OF THOSE WORTHLESS KRILL

BUT THEY SHOULD BE GONE BY NOW.

SO YOU TWO AREN'T BEING
TORTURED BY COUSIN BLACKJACK?

NO, SPONGEBOB,
YOUR COUSIN BLACKJACK

HAS PAID HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY

AND RENOUNCED
HIS CRIMINAL WAYS.

NEVER AGAIN WILL HE LITTER.

Blackjack: THAT'S RIGHT,
LITTLE MAN.

OH, WELL, HERE COMES
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

HE'S BEEN TALKING ALL DAY ABOUT

PLAYING WITH HIS
LITTLE COUSIN AGAIN.

HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

JUMPING ROPE WITH YOU
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

DID YOU COME HERE TO QUIVER
LIKE A JELLYFISH

OR DID YOU COME TO WRESTLE?

[WHIMPERING]

TO QUIVER.

I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WERE A LITTLE MAN.

PREPARE TO RELIVE
YOUR PAST IN THE PRESENT.

[LAUGHING]

[WHIMPERING]

COME ON, LITTLE BOBBY.

DON'T LET HIM BEAT YOU.

YOU'VE GOT TO STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF THIS TIME.

THAT'S IT!

I AM NOT GONNA
TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

I AM PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

YOU WANT TO TUSSLE?

WELL, LET'S TUSSLE IT UP!

[BOTH SCREAMING...]

COUSIN BLACKJACK?

IN THE LIVING FLESH.

[GRUNTING...]

[GRUNTING]

[LAUGHING]

THAT TICKLES.

JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS,
EH, COUSIN?

YEAH, BLACKJACK,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

WHERE I DEFEAT

NOTORIOUS ARCHVILLAIN
JACK M. CRAZYFISH

USING THE SHEER FORCE

OF MY AWESOMELY
DEVELOPED MUSCULATURE.

[INHALES]

[STRAINED GROANING]

[EXHALES]

UNCONTROLLABLY AT ME.

[DISAGREEING]: MEOW.

YOU PROMISE YOU WON'T LAUGH?

OK, HERE GOES.

GARY, I GAVE MYSELF
A BLACK EYE

TRYING TO OPEN
THE TOOTHPASTE.

[RESTRAINED SNICKER]

THANKS FOR NOT LAUGHING, GARE.

I KNEW YOU'D...

GARE?

HI, SPONGEBOB.
[SCREAMS]

HEY, COOL GLASSES.

CAN I TRY THEM ON... OH!

IT'S ALL BLACK AND SWOLLEN.

HOW'D YOU MESS
YOUR EYE UP, SPONGEBOB?

DID SOMEBODY HIT YOU?

WHERE IS HE?

YEAH, WE'LL SETTLE
THIS LIKE MEN.

WE'LL SUE HIM.

NO, NO, IT'S OK, PATRICK.

HE, UH...

HE LEARNED HIS LESSON.

ARE YOU SURE, SPONGEBOB?

WHO WAS THIS GUY ANYWAY?

HMM...

IT WAS JACK M. CRAZYFISH.

YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
LIKE THIS GUY, PATRICK.

HE WAS ABOUT 60 FEET TALL.

[QUIVERING]: OH.

YEAH, HE WAS BIG AND MEAN.

OH, BUT OL' SPONGEBOB HERE

KNOWS HOW TO TEACH
A LUMMOX SOME MANNERS.

WHAT DID YOU DO?

I HANDLED HIM
THE SAME WAY I HANDLE

ALL ENORMOUS
MUSCLEBOUND VILLAINS.

WITH TEARS?

UH, NO, WITH A LITTLE

HIYAH!

AND A KAZOW!

AND A GALLON OF
HIYAH, HIYAH, HA!

YEAH, HE NEVER
KNEW WHAT HIT 'EM.

WELL, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

I WOKE UP...
OH, I MEAN, I...

I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

YOU WHOOPED HIM
WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.

THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN, PATRICK.

WELL, SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY.

THERE GOES A REAL HERO.

WHA, WAHBAHBAH!

[LAUGHS] SLUGGER,
THAT'S ME.

WHAT THE?

[RUMBLING]

[MOOING]YEE HAW.

GET ALONG LITTLE FISHIES.

HI, SANDY.

WHOA.

HOT CATSNAKE IN A BARN.

LOOK AT YOUR EYE.

LAND SAKES.

THAT'S QUITE A SHINER
YOU GOT THERE.

WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY NONE.

I KNOW SOME NATURAL
REMEDIES THAT'LL...

KEEP YOUR NATURAL
REMEDIES TO YOURSELF.

MANLY DUDES LIKE
ME DON'T NEED 'EM.

I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

I GOT THIS BLACK EYE IN A FIGHT.

A FIGHT?

WELL, THERE'S NO
SHAME IN LOSING.

LOSE?

SANDY, I TAUGHT THE FISH
WHO TANGLED WITH ME

A LESSON HE SHAN'T SOON FORGET.

WHY?

DID HE WRITE IT DOWN?

NO, I ENGRAVED IT
ON HIS PAIN GLAND.

WELL, WHAT TYPE OF MAN SCUFFLES
BOOTS WITH YOU AND LOSES?

OH, THIS WAS NO MERE MAN.

HE WAS THE NOTORIOUS OUTLAW

JACK M. CRAZYFISH!

JACK M. CRAZYFISH?

IT ALL HAPPENED
LATE LAST NIGHT...

...I WAS WALKING HOME
FROM WORK... ALONE

WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, CRAZYFISH
SPRANG UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

HE THREW A GIANT TIRE

AT THE BACK OF MY HEAD.[LAUGHING...]

THEN, HE STOOD OVER ME TO GLOAT.

I JUMPED UP AND KARATE
KICKED HIS HAIRPIECE
RIGHT OFF OF ITS SNAPS.

HE WAS SO ASHAMED
HE RAN ALL THE WAY HOME

LEAVING BEHIND A POOL OF TEARS.

WHICH I THEN PROCEEDED TO SCOOP
UP IN MY VICTORY TANKARD

AND ENJOY AS A NICE
REFRESHING BEVERAGE.

SO HOW'D YOU GET
THE BLACK EYE THEN?

OH, YEAH, WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

I HAD MISCALCULATED THE
TRAJECTORY OF MY CUP

AND THE STRAW
JABBED ME IN THE EYE

GIVING ME THIS AWFUL SHINER.

[BEEPING]

WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LATE
FOR YOUR DAY JOB, KILLER.

AW, PHOOEY.

LATE SCHMATE.

A TOUGH GUY LIKE ME CAN SHOW UP
TO WORK WHENEVER HE WANTS.

ADIOS.

SPONGEBOB IS 131/2 MINUTES
LATE FOR DUTY.

I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE THIS MEANS
HE WAS IN A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT.

WELL, LOOKS LIKE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT PART.

OH.

YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, PAL,
DO THE RIGHT THING.

JUST KEEP ON WALKING.

UGH, DO YOU MIND?

WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE
A DECENT MEAL HERE.

THAT'S RIGHT.

[SPONGEBOB CLEARS THROAT]

SPONGEBOB, I'M...

DAHDAHDAHDAH,
I'M JUST GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE, SQUIDWARD.

SPARE YOU THE OXYGEN.

WE ALL KNOW YOU WEAKER FOLK
CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE IT.

ALL RIGHT FOLKS, LISTEN UP.

'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA
SAY THIS ONCE.

Spongebob: Tough guys don't
like to repeat themselves.

I'M TALKING TO YOU, GRANDMA!

NOW I SUPPOSE ALL OF
YOU ARE WONDERING

HOW I GOT THIS BLACK EYE.

Squidward: NOT REALLY.

ALL RIGHT, WHO SAID THAT?

WAS IT YOU, GRANDMA?

IT WAS ME,
I SAID IT.

[HISSING]

WELL, FOLKS, I DON'T HAPPEN
TO SEE IT AS A SHINER

SO MUCH AS A SHINING TROPHY
OF MY GLORIOUS TRIUMPH

OVER THE FORCES OF EVIL.

OH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

WHO IN THE NAME OF NEPTUNE
WOULD WANT TO TANGLE

WITH A GUY LIKE
SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS?

WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHO?

IT WAS A PEACEFUL MORNING
IN BIKINI BOTTOM.

I EMERGED FROM
MY FRUITSHAPED BUNGALOW
FRESH AS A BEE

[WOMAN SCREAMS]WHEN A WANTON CRY OF DISTRESS

POUNDED AGAINST MY EARDRUM.

HOLD IT.

SPONGES DON'T HAVE EARDRUMS.

HE'S RIGHT.

HEY, LET'S SAVE ALL THE
QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END.

AS I WAS SAYING...

I QUICKLY LOCATED
THE SOURCE OF THE CRY

WHICH WAS A VICTIM
TIED AT MY FEET.
[SCREAMS]

DON'T WORRY,
I'LL SAVE YOU.

...I ASSURED...

WHEN A LARGE BOWLING PIN
STRUCK ME IN THE FACE.

THE HURLER WAS NONE OTHER
THAN JACK M. CRAZYFISH.

AND I COULD TELL BY THAT
COLD SORE ON HIS LIP

THAT TODAY HE MEANT BUSINESS.

WITH CATLIKE REFLEXES

I PREEMPTED HIS ATTACK.

BUT THE SCOUNDREL
HAD ME SABOTAGED

AND I FELL FACE DOWN ON
A PILE OF EXTRA LARGE STAPLES.

HE LUNGED AT ME.

BUT I GOT HIM IN THE RIBS WITH
MY NOVELTY FEATHER DUSTER.

DOWN HE FELL LIKE A MIGHTY OAK.[SLOW HOWL... THUD]

AND THERE HE LAY.

THE VERY THOUGHT
OF BEING VANQUISHED

MADE JACK M. CRAZYFISH
BURST INTO TEARS.

THE FORCE OF HIS CRYING
WAS SO STRONG

I HAD TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION.

BUT ONE OF THE BLASTS
WENT HAYWIRE

AND HIT ME RIGHT IN THE FACE.

AND THAT'S HOW I GOT
THIS BLACK EYE

BY GIVING JACK M. CRAZYFISH

THE WHOMPIN' OF A LIFETIME.

WHOO... FOOTBALL!

UH, WHAT DID YOU SAY
HE LOOKED LIKE AGAIN?

OH, KIND OF TALL,
HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE...

LITTLE GREEN HAT?

I KIND OF THOUGHT IT WAS TEAL

BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE
HIM ALL RIGHT.

WAIT A SECOND.

HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WAS
WEARING A GREEN HAT [GASPS]?

[GASP]

[GASPS]

[GASPS]

HE'S... REAL.

I'M LOOKING
FOR SPONGEBOB SQUARE...

MR. CRAZYFISH, PLEASE
DON'T SKIN ME ALIVE.

I MADE ALL THAT STUFF UP.

I WAS JUST KIDDING ABOUT
WHOMPING YOU, RIGHT FOLKS?

YOU REMEMBER.

I LIKED THE PART
WHERE YOU TOLD US

HOW HE WAS CRYING LIKE A BABY.

[HYPERVENTILATING]

[DOOR OPENS]... HI, GARY.

[HYPERVENTILATING]

ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

I HAD A TOOTHPASTE TUBE,
LIKE THIS.

BUT I COULDN'T GET IT OPEN
'CAUSE THE CAP WAS STUCK.

AND I GUESS...

I HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING MY
ARMS OUT THAT MUCH LATELY.

SO I OPENED IT UP
LIKE THIS.

THEN I WAS WALKIN', LIKE THIS.

AND I DIDN'T SEE WHERE
THE CAP WENT, LIKE THIS.

I SLIPPED ON IT

AND I LANDED RIGHT ON MY WRENCH,
LIKE THIS.

[CLANG]

AND I GAVE MYSELF A BLACK EYE,
LIKE THIS.

UH, LIKE THESE.

SO YOU SEE?

I MADE IT ALL UP SO I COULD
KEEP FROM LOOKING STUPID.

MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT?

UH, NOT REALLY.

I'M HERE BECAUSE I HEARD YOU
MAKE A REALLY GOOD KRABBY PATTY.

ONE SUPER HOT AND DELICIOUS
CUSTOM ORDER KRABBY PATTY
WITH EXTRA SAUCE, MILORD.

SERVED DIRECTLY TO YOUR
WAITING... OW!

HEAD AND NECK AREA.

SIR, PLEASE, I AM SO SORRY.

WHERE I'M FROM,
SORRY DON'T CUT IT.

WE SETTLE THINGS
IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY.

Spongebob: NO!

Man: MERMAID MAN

SO I DREW YOU A HOT BATH.

WELL, THANKS, PATRICK.

I DID GET A TRIFLE
UNHINGED, DIDN'T I?

OOPS...

I FORGOT THE BATH BEADS.

THANKS, PATRICK,
YOU'RE A REAL PAL.

[CHUCKLES]
FUNNY LOOKING BATH BEADS.

THEY ALMOST LOOK LIKE CARROTS.

CARROTS?

YOU'RE MAKING SOUP
OUT OF ME.

I WAS NOT.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE STEW.

[PANTING]

WHEW.

I'M GETTING TIRED.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A NAP
ON THIS NICE SOFT BED.

THERE, THAT'S IT.

HERE, I'LL TUCK YOU IN WITH
THIS NICE SOFT BLANKET.

AND WHAT'S A BLANKET
WITHOUT A LITTLE KETCHUP?

NEEMEENEEMEE...

THIS ISN'T A BED.

WAIT, COME BACK.

Spongebob: YOU'RE NOT
PROPERLY SEASONED.

MMM...

AHH!

Spongebob: AHH!

[PANTING]

Patrick: WHOA, HEY...

GIVE ME THAT
KETCHUP BACK.

NO.

[GROANING]

GOT YA.

NO, GOT YOU.

I GOT YOU.

CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU DID IT.

DID WHAT?

WHY EARN YOUR
SURVIVALIST MEDALS, OF COURSE.

ONLY A HARDCORE SURVIVALIST

WOULD BREAK DOWN AND
NEARLY EAT HIS BEST PAL.

WHY DO YOU CARE
IF WE'RE SURVIVALISTS?

[CACKLING]

'CAUSE I'M NOT
JUST SOME OLD HERMIT.

I'M SANDY CHEEKS,
SURVIVALIST EXTRAORDINAIRE.

SANDY?
SANDY?

IT WEREN'T NO ACCIDENT THAT
YOU FELL OUT OF MY TRUCK.

I WAS JUST TESTING
YOUR SURVIVAL SKILLS.

YOU PLANNED THIS?
YOU PLANNEDTHIS?

YUP...

AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY
YOU BOTH PASSED.

HERE'S YOUR SURVIVALIST MEDALS.

HOORAY.
HOORAY.

WOW, IT'S GREAT THAT
WE WON OUR MEDALS.

BUT I'M STILL HUNGRY.

WHAT YA DOING?

UH, FELLAS?

EAT OR

THERE'S A WEIRD THING STICKING

GO GET SOME SHOVELS

NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE

I'LL SAY.

PLUS, LOOK AT WHAT

GO ON, YOU FIRST.

KIND OF DARK, HUH?

YEAH, DARK.

WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A LIGHT SWITCH

FOUND IT.

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

HEY, PATRICK, LOOK.

WE'RE MOVING.

OH, HOLD IT, SPONGEBOB.

YOU'D BETTER LET ME DRIVE.

GIVE ME THAT WHEEL.

NO, LET GO.

I WANT TO DRIVE.

[CRASHING]

[SIGHING]

I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SQUIDWARD.

WHERE ARE ALL THE CUSTOMERS?

I KNOW THE KRUSTY KRAB
ISN'T BIKINI BOTTOM'S
MOST PRESTIGIOUS EATERY

BUT AT LEAST IT'S BETTER
THAN THAT SALTY OLD CHUMBUCKET
ACROSS THE STREET

AND THAT'S OUR ONLY COMPETITION.

AM I GETTING PAID EXTRA
FOR THIS CONVERSATION?

COME ON, SQUIDWARD.

CAN'T YOU JUST PRETEND TO LISTEN
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE?

DO IT FOR OLD MR. KRABS.

[SIGHING]

WELL, SINCE YOU CAN'T
BRING ANY CUSTOMERS
INTO THE KRUSTY KRAB

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
BRINGING THE KRUSTY KRAB
TO THE CUSTOMERS?

QUIET, SQUIDWARD,
I'M BRAINSTORMING.

OOH, OOH.

WHAT IF,
INSTEAD OF BRINGING CUSTOMERS
TO THE KRUSTY KRAB

WE COULD BRING THE KRUSTY KRAB
TO THE CUSTOMERS?

LALA, LALALALALALA,
LALALALA

WHY, YES, OF COURSE.

BUT HOW?

CAN WE PARK HERE?

HEY, MR. KRABS.

LOOK WHAT PATRICK AND I FOUND.

WE'RE GONNA USE IT TO GO
ON A LONG JOURNEY.

OR EVEN AROUND THE BLOCK.

THAT'S IT.

WE'LL TAKE THE KRUSTY KRAB
ON THE ROAD.

SO LONG, LAD.

MAKE ME LOTS OF MONEY.

BYE, SQUIDWARD.

BYE, MR. KRABS.

BYE, SQUIDWARD.

YOU SAID "BYE, SQUIDWARD" TWICE.

I LIKE SQUIDWARD.

A TRAVELING RESTAURANT, EH?

IT'S NOT FAIR.

I HAD THAT IDEA YEARS AGO.

NO MATTER.

IF MR. KRABS
WANTS TO PLAY DIRTY

THEN PLANKTON'S READY
FOR HIS TURN TO TAKE HIS TURN.

[PLANKTON LAUGHING...]

HELLO.

HELLO.

COULD I INTEREST YOU
IN A KRABBY PATTY?

NO THANKS.

NOW WHAT?

I DON'T KNOW, PATRICK.

MR. KRABS SAID,
IF WE DIDN'T FIND CUSTOMERS,
NOT TO COME BACK.

ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE OUR FIRST CUSTOMER, SIR.

UH, YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.

SpongeBob: WAIT.

WE'LL PAY YOU.

HEY, THANKS AGAIN, GUYS.

GOOD LUCK WITH THE RESTAURANT.

THANK YOU, SIR.

WOULD YOU LIKE A CHUM BURGER?

UH, DOES IT COME IN RASPBERRY?

UH, NO.

BLUEBERRY?

NO.

UM... RASPBERRY?

OH, COME ON, KID,
YOU ASKED ME THAT ALREADY.

NOW QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

HEY, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO MY SON THAT WAY.

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

I'M PLANKTON, YOU OLD HAG,
AND YOUR SON
SMELLS LIKE BOOGERS.

HEY, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO MY WIFE THAT WAY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT, FATTIE.

THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

HEY, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO MY GRANDSON LIKE THAT.

SOMEONE OUGHT TO PUT YOU
IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

SOMEONE SHOULD PUT YOU
IN A BOX FLOATING
DOWN THE RIVER, GRANDMA.

YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY.

I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

WHAT THE?

NO, CONTROLS MALFUNCTIONING.

WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE...]

ALL RIGHT, GET HIM!

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

WON'T MR. KRABS BE SO PROUD
OF US WHEN HE FINDS OUT
HOW GOOD WE'RE DOING?

SEE ANY NEW CUSTOMERS, PATRICK?

NO, BUT I SEE A SIGN.

IT SAYS, "WARNING: AB EYES?"

HERE, LET ME SEE.

NO, PATRICK, THAT SAYS "ABYSS."

Patrick: OH, OK.

WHAT'S AN ABYSS, SPONGEBOB?

AN ABYSS IS A BOTTOMLESS...

...CHASM!

PAT, WE'RE FALLING!

AND NOW WE'RE BATHED IN
AN EERIE RED LIGHT!

YES, YES!

[ALARM BLARING]

AND NOW, A DEAFENING
WARNING SIREN.

[IMITATING ALARM]

[GROWLING]

[SCREAMING]

LOOK, PATRICK.

WE FLOATED BACK UP OUT OF
THE DEEP, DARK, DEPRESSING,
HORRIBLE ABYSS.

[CREATURE GROWLING]

WHO ARE YOU CALLING DARK
AND DEPRESSING?

[STAMMERING]

WE DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY,
MISTER SEA MONSTER, SIR.

UM, WHAT WE REALLY WANT
TO KNOW IS, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

HUNGRY?

I'VE BEEN ASLEEP FOR 79 YEARS,
WHICH MEANS MY LAST MEAL
WAS 79 YEARS AGO.

YES, I'M HUNGRY.

WELL THEN, TRY ONE OF
OUR KRABBY PATTIES.

[MAKING EATING NOISES]

MM, THAT'S THE BEST THING
I'VE TASTED SINCE
THAT SEWAGE SPILL BACK IN '76.

I'LL TAKE 640 OF THEM.

WHOOHOO!

ORDER UP.

[MAKING EATING NOISES]

NOW THAT THOSE TWO
ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE

ALL THE CUSTOMERS'LL
COME RUNNING TO ME.

THIS CALLS
FOR "DRASTICEREST" MEASURES.

OK, YOU BUMS,
TIME FOR THE SECOND COURSE.

CHUM CHARGES.

[SCREAMING]

SPONGEBOB, OUR HOME'S
BEEN BREACHED.

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

NO.

NEITHER DO I.

YES!

[LAUGHING]

I SUNK THE KRUSTY KRAB.

I SUNK THE KRUSTY KRAB.

I SUNK THE... OH!

EH, WHO NEEDS
THAT RUSTBUCKET ANYHOW?

COME ON IN THERE.

I WANT MORE SANDWICHES.

SPONGEBOB, LOOK.

WHAT IS IT?

IT'S A LIQUID.

SpongeBob: NO, IT'S A SOLID,
IT'S A SOLID.

IT'S A "LOLSQUID."

ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING
ON IN THERE?

HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A SANDWICH TO ME.

NOT JUST A SANDWICH.

IT'S A "CHUMWICH."

MM.

NOW THAT'S A SANDWICH.

ANYTHING ELSE
BEFORE WE SHELL OFF?

I WANT DESSERT.

WE DON'T HAVE DESSERT.

DON'T GIVE ANOTHER PENNY
TO THOSE FAST FOOD PHONIES.

THAT'S RIGHT,
THEY STOLE MY IDEA.

MY, MY, MY...

[GRUNTING AND SCREAMING]

HEY, A CHOCOLATE ECLAIR.

NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE
DESSERT TO ME.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG, SEE?

[SCREAMING]

HERE YOU ARE, MR. KRABS.

JUST LIKE NEW AGAIN.

NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS KEEP SPONGEBOB AWAY FROM...

WE'RE BACK, MR. KRABS.

TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME,
TELL ME, TELL ME.

YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT,
MR. KRABS.

WE HAD SO MANY NEW CUSTOMERS.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

TELL ME ABOUT THE MONEY.

THERE WE WERE, AT THE BOTTOM OF
A DEEP, DARK ABYSS, AND WE HAD
TO LET GO OF SOMETHING HEAVY.

AND PAPER.

YOU LET GO OF ALL
THE MONEY I EARNED AS BALLAST?

BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
WE DID MANAGE TO BRING BACK
37,000 POUNDS

OF THESE DECORATIVE
DEEP SEA ROCKS.

[♪...]

WHERE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND
NOW, SPONGEBOB?

WELL, ACCORDING TO THIS TSHIRT,
IT SAYS MY BEST FRIEND
IS RIGHT HERE.

[LAUGHING]

HOW ABOUT NOW?

RIGHT BY MY SIDE.

[LAUGHING]

WOW, CLOTHING THAT ANNOUNCES
OUR FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER.

LET'S GET 'EM, PATRICK.

CAN I HELP YOU, BOYS?

I BELIEVE YOU CAN.

MY BEST FRIEND AND I
WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE...

[SOBBING]

PATRICK, WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

YOU FOUND A NEW BEST FRIEND.

OH, WHAT ARE YOU...?

[SCREAMING]

WAIT, NO, THIS ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

[SOBBING]

PATRICK, LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU.

EXCUSE ME,
BUT DOES THIS COME IN...

NO!

YOU'RE NOT MY BEST FRIEND.

WE GOT TO DITCH THESE OUTFITS.

THEY'RE SENDING OUT
THE WRONG SIGNALS.

[GRUNTING]

[SCREAMING]

WE NEED NEW OUTFITS TO SHOW
OUR BEST "FRIENDINESS," PAT.

YOU MEAN LIKE THOSE GUYS?

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

YEAH, JUST LIKE THOSE GUYS.

[SPONGEBOB SIGHING]

BEST FRIEND OUTFITS LIKE THESE
REALLY MAKE A STATEMENT.

LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

WHOA, I LIKE THAT ONE.

HEY MISTER, WHERE DID YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS GET
YOUR MATCHING OUTFITS?

OH, NO, THESE AREN'T MY FRIENDS.

IN FACT, I HATE
JUST ABOUT EVERYONE HERE

BUT MY LOVE FOR HISTORICAL
BATTLES IS SO GREAT

I JOIN THESE LOSERS
EVERY YEAR TO REENACT
THE BATTLE OF BIKINI BOTTOM.

THERE WAS A BATTLE
OF BIKINI BOTTOM?

[GASPING]

WELL, DUH, SPONGEBOB.

IT'S ONLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
EVENT IN BIKINI BOTTOM HISTORY.

A LONG TIME AGO, THE TOWN
WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS

THOSE WHO SPENT ALL THEIR TIME
WASHING THEIR HANDS
LIKE SOFTIES...

CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

Patrick: AND THOSE WHO HAD
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO
WITH THEIR TIME.

[TOILET FLUSHING]

[SIGHING]

WELL, LOOKS GOOD TO ME.

THAT IS TRULY DISGUSTING.

OH YEAH?

YOU CAN'T GO AROUND
OUR TOWN TOUCHING THINGS
WITH THOSE FILTHY MITTS.

OH YEAH?

YES.

[GRUNTING...]

WASH YOUR HANDS.

NEVER.

AND THAT'S HOW WE WON OUR RIGHT
TO WASH AS WE PLEASE.

THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

YOU DON'T WASH
YOUR HANDS, PATRICK?

NEVER HAVE, NEVER WILL.

BLECH.

DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?

HUH, SPONGEBOB?

THEY ONLY HAD
ONE ICE CREAM CONE.

THAT'S OK.

THANK YOU, FRIEND.

SO ANYWAY, I SAID...

WAIT.

YOU GOT SOMETHING
ON YOUR TONGUE.

REALLY?

HERE, I'LL GET IT.

THANK YOU.

FRANKLY, YES, PATRICK,
THAT DOES BOTHER ME.

WELL THEN I GUESS
WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

[GRUNTING]

DO I HAVE TO
SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?

YOU ARE... UM...

HOW DO YOU SPELL
"NOT MY FRIEND?"

OH, COME ON.

WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

WE'LL START A NEW LIFE.

JUST YOU, ME, AND THIS CAN
OF DISINFECTANT SPRAY.

COME ON IN, PATRICK.

HERE, LET ME TAKE
YOUR COAT FOR YOU.

NO THANK YOU.

I HAPPEN TO LIKE
MY VARIOUS SMELLS AND GERMS.

BUT BEING CLEAN
IS SO MUCH BETTER.

WELL, SAYS YOU.

I LIKE DIRTY.

CLEAN.

DIRTY.

CLEAN.

UH, EXCUSE US, BUT WE HAVE
A BATTLE TO REENACT.

FINE.

IF THAT'S HOW IT IS, THEN
I AM JOINING THE OTHER SIDE.

FINE, ME TOO.

OH, COME ON.

LET'S GO PLAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

HAH, GOT YOUR NOSE.

HEY, GIVE IT BACK.

NOT UNTIL YOU WASH YOUR HANDS.

OH YEAH?

WELL, I GOT YOUR EYEBALLS.

[GIGGLING]

HUH?

[LAUGHING]

WHOA.

EW, BRAIN JUICE.

DO YOU GIVE UP YET?

SORRY, PATRICK,
BUT A FILTHY SLOB LIKE YOU

IS NO MATCH FOR
A CLEANCUT FELLOW LIKE ME.

YOUR PANTS ARE FALLING DOWN.

REALLY?

I'LL FIX IT.

SATISFIED?

THERE, YOU LOOK GOOD NOW.

YOU COULD USE
A MAKEOVER, THOUGH.

UGH, LOOK AT THOSE FEET.

WHY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?

DON'T WORRY.

I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

[GRUNTING]

NO, NOT A PEDICURE.

[SCREAMING]

NO, NO, NOT THAT.

ANYTHING BUT THAT.

NOT NAIL POLISH.

YOU SICK LITTLE MONSTER.

FACE MY MORNING BREATH.

YOU, SIR, COULD USE
SOME DENTAL HYGIENE?

WHO, ME?

MY TEETH ARE FINE, SEE?

A LITTLE TOOTHPASTE,
AND YOU'LL HAVE TEETH LIKE MINE.

[SCREAMING]

YOU GOT TO BRUSH
IN LITTLE CIRCLES.

[LAUGHING]

[GURGLING]

[SCREAMING]

MINTY FRESH.

TASTE PIT, EVILDOER.

[GRUNTING]

YOU'RE A STINKY,
STINKY SEA STAR.

I THINK YOU COULD USE
A SHOT OF THIS.

NO, NO, NOT, NOT DEODORANT.

[SCREAMING]

[GROANING]

MY BEAUTIFUL PITSTINK.

IT'S GONE.

THE GLOVES ARE OFF NOW.

IT'S BOOGER TIME.

OH, BOOGER "SHMOOGER."

YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A NOSE.

OH YEAH?

[GROANING]

[GASPING]

[SCREAMING]

BOOGER!

[SCREAMING]

RUN!

RUN, MR. KRABS.

PATRICK IS DIGGING FOR GOLD.

[SCREAMING]

GOLD?

[LAUGHING]

DID YOU GET ANY
OF PATRICK'S GOLD?

HE'S NOT DIGGING FOR
ANY GOLD I'M LOOKING FOR.

AHHA.

I'VE GOT YOU NOW.

CAREFUL, PATRICK.

I'VE GOT A WEAPON.

[GRUNTING]

UGH, RAW ONIONS.

[SOBBING]

THAT DOES IT.

SEE THIS?

A KRABBY PATTY?

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, EAT IT?

OH, I'M NOT GOING TO EAT IT.

NO, NOT PATTY SOCKS.

THAT'S RIGHT, YOUR PRECIOUS
PATTIES ON MY STINKY FEET.

YOU BETTER STOP THAT.

[LAUGHING]

STINKY, LITTLE FEET.

OOH, YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW.

HOPPING...

...CRABS.

[GASPING]

HEY, I GOT MY FILTH BACK.

NOT FOR LONG, MR. STINKY SHORTS.

YOU WON'T HAVE YOUR FILTH
ONCE I USE THIS ON YOU.

NO, NOT SOAP.

YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

TRY ME.

STAY BACK.

I'LL DO IT.

IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

[GROANING]

[GRUNTING]

[LAUGHING]

MY BEAUTIFUL FILTH.

IT'S GONE.

I'M SQUEAKY CLEAN.

[GRUNTING]

I'M COVERED IN MUCK AND SCUM.

MAN, TO GET MY FILTH BACK,
I'LL HAVE TO WALLOW
IN MUD FOREVER.

IT'LL TAKE WEEKS
FOR ME TO GET CLEAN.

I'LL NEED 20 BATHS A DAY.

SLATHER TOE JAM ON MY ARMPITS.

I'LL HAVE TO DISINFECT
MY EYEBALLS.

SMEAR SLIME ON MY TEETH.

AND DRY CLEAN MY UVULA.

[LAUGHING]

ALL RIGHT!

NOW THAT I'M FILTHY, I CAN SPEND
ALL DAY GETTING CLEAN.

AND SINCE I'M CLEAN,
I CAN GET EVEN FILTHIER.

THANKS, SPONGEBOB.

NO, PATRICK, THANK YOU.

YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND EVER.

Man: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

THIS BATTLE ISN'T OVER
UNTIL WE HAVE A WINNER.

FRET NOT, MY FRIEND,
FOR I HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH.

IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER
ONE IS DIRTY OR CLEAN

FOR CAN CLEANLINESS EXIST
WITHOUT FILTHINESS?

AND WOULD WE KNOW FILTHINESS
WITHOUT CLEANLINESS?

WE MUST NOT REENACT
THE HISTORY THAT DIVIDES US.

RATHER, WE MUST EMBRACE
THAT WHICH DRAWS US TOGETHER.

ALL MUST BE FREE
TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATH.

RIGHT, FRIEND PATRICK?

SQUEAKY CLEAN.

SQUEAKY, IT'S SQUEAKY.

MMHM.

HE HAS EMBRACED THE TRUTH.

WOW.

I THINK THE LITTLE YELLOW GUY
HAS TAUGHT US A VALUABLE LESSON.

AND WHAT IS THAT, MY SON?

THAT REENACTING BATTLES
IS REALLY LAME.

COME ON, GUYS.

LET'S PLAY SOMETHING MORE MANLY,
LIKE FOOTBALL.

OR HOCKEY.

OR KNITTING FLUFFY SWEATERS.

YEAH!

COME, PATRICK.

MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

SPONGEBOB THAT UTTERED A NOTE

BUT IF I WERE TO CRAFT ANOTHER

THE DIMENSIONS OF
THAT HOLLOW CENTER

MULTIPLIED BY
THE NUMBER OF HOLES

MAY OFFER ANOTHER TUNE.

ONE THAT COULD
SOOTHE THOSE JELLYFISH.

BUT WHICH ONE IS THE RIGHT SIZE?

EH, I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO MAKE A BUNCH OF 'EM.

COME ALONG, SISTERS.

PAY NOT MIND TO THIS
CRIMSON ABOMINATION.

AHH...

GREETINGS.

ALTHOUGH YOUR
ESTABLISHMENT
SEEMS REPUGNANT

AND FOUL IN NATURE

IT SEEMS NOT TO OFFEND
OUR SENSITIVITIES.

IT IS FOR THAT REASON
PLUS THE FACT THAT

WE HAVE BEEN STUCK ON A TOUR BUS
FOR SEVERAL DAYS

THAT MY SISTERS AND I WOULD
LIKE TO EAT SOMETHING HERE.

OK, BUT FIRST LET ME
CALL THE MORTICIAN

AND TELL HIM HIS
UNIFORM'S BEEN STOLEN.

DELICIOUS KRABBY PATTIES.

WELL, MR. UH...

KRABS, M'LADY.

MR. "GRABS".

OF BEHAVING LIKE
A CIVILIZED BOTTOM FEEDER.

PERHAPS YOUR

IT'S... IT'S SHAMELESS
AND DISGUSTING.

AVERT YOUR EYES.

YOUNG MAN...

WHAT HAS CAUSED YOU
TO ACT LIKE THIS?

I MUST KNOW.

ACTUALLY MA'AM...

WAS THE ABSOLUTE FUN AND
DELICIOUSNESS OF A KRABBY PATTY.

KRABBY PATTY?

YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

WELL, ANYTHING THIS FUN AND
DELICIOUS CAN'T BE GOOD.

WHY, WHAT WOULD THIS WORLD BE

IF EVERYONE CAVORTED
IN SUCH A MANNER?

WHO ARE YOU
WITH YOUR TIGHT LIPS

RAISED EYEBROWS
AND CONSERVATIVE CLOTHES?

I AM MISS GRETEL PUSS.

WE ARE THE UNITED
ORGANIZATION OF FISH

AGAINST THINGS THAT
ARE FUN AND DELICIOUS.

OR TUOFATTAFAD FOR SHORT.

AND WE ARE GOING TO BAN
THESE SOCALLED KRABBY PATTIES

AND CLOSE YOUR
RESTAURANT FOREVER.

WHAT THE...

MISS "GRISTLE" PUSS?

MAYBE IF YOU WERE TO TASTE
THE KRABBY PATTY FOR YOURSELF

YOU TWO COULD EXPERIENCE
THE AWESOME PLEASURE.

I WOULD SOON AS SPROUT LEGS
AND DO THE WATUSI.

OOH, OK.

UH, IT DON'T MATTER
ANYWAY, LAD.

SHE CAN'T CLOSE US DOWN.

Krabs: SHE CLOSED US DOWN.

I'M RUINED... [SOBBING]

HOW DID IT
COME TO THIS?

YOU CALLED MISS GRISTLE PUSS
A DISGUSTING, OLD PRUNE

THEN YOU THREATENED HER
WITH A FRENCH FRY STRAINER.

WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HER
HUSBAND WAS THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

THANKS AGAIN, AL.

ANYTIME, HONEY.

SEE YOU AT HOME FOR DINNER.

[SLURPS] MM, I'M STARVING.

YEEHAW.

I JUST LOVE THAT MAN.

HOW LONG HAS HE
BEEN STANDING OVER THERE?

UM... FOUR DAYS.

IT'S NO USE.

I'M RUINED... [SOBBING]

[HYSTERICAL SOBBING]

YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD.

THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
KRABBY PATTIES AGAIN

WOULD BE IF YOU
OPENED A PLACE THAT DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE A RESTAURANT

AND DID IT SECRETLY.

THAT'S IT.

A SECRET KRUSTY KRAB.

AND I KNOW JUST
WHERE TO OPEN IT.

THERE YOU ARE, BETSY,
GOOD AS NEW.

MMM...

MR. KRABS?
AH!

WHOA, SORRY.

I WAS JUST WONDERING...

YOU KNOW, LAD,
I CAN REMEMBER A TIME

WHEN PEOPLE USED TO KNOCK BEFORE
ENTERING SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME.

YEAH, BUT THIS IS MY HOME.

OH, YEAH.

HEY, GUYS.

HEY, PATRICK.

THANKS FOR HELPING OUT TODAY.

YOU BET.

WHERE'D YOU WANT
THESE EXTRAS BUNS?

PATRICK, THAT BAG
IS TOTALLY EMPTY.

[BELCH]... OOPS.

Plankton: HAPPY DAY, KAREN.

THAT FOOL, KRABS, CHANGED
THE NAME OF HIS RESTAURANT

TO "THE CLOSED KRAB".

EVERYONE WILL
THINK IT'S CLOSED

AND COME EAT HERE INSTEAD.

HE'LL BE RUINED BY TOMORROW.

HEHHEH, WHAT AN IDIOT.

It is closed.

WHAT?

Miss Gristle Puss
and her husband

banned Krabby Patties
for being fun and delicious.

BANNED?

THEN THAT MEANS

MY DAY OF RECKONING
HAS COME AT LAST.

I'VE WON, I TELL YOU,
I'VE WON.

AND WHAT BETTER WAY
THAN BY DEFAULT.

Where are you going?

OH, OUT TO CELEBRATE.

DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

QUIT SHOVING.

I WASN'T SHOVING.

I WAS JUST GOING LIKE THAT

AND YOU HAPPENED
TO BE STANDING THERE.

THAT'S CALLED SHOVING.

NO, IT ISN'T.

YES, IT IS.

NOPE.

EXCUSE ME,

IF KRABBY PATTIES
ARE ILLEGAL NOW

AREN'T WE BREAKING THE LAW?

THERE'S AN OLD SAYING, LAD.

WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU

USUALLY SUCCEEDS
IN THE SECOND ATTEMPT.

BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO
DO WITH MAKING KRABBY PATTIES?

NOTHING, BUT IF YOU DON'T GET
OUT THERE AND START COOKING

I'LL MAKE YOU START
TAKING WEEKENDS OFF.

Spongebob: NO!

SO MR. KRABS IS OPERATING

UNDER THE TABLE, HUH?

WELL, TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME.

[LOUD BELCH]

SPONGEBOB, WHAT'S
THE MEANING OF THIS?

YOUR STATION
LOOKS HORRIBLE.

TAKE SOME PRIDE

LOOK AT YOUR COUSIN,
STANLEY, FOR EXAMPLE.

SPIFFIN' UP HIS WORK SPACE

WITH MEANINGFUL PHOTOS
OF THE CUSTOMERS.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

UM... SIR?

YOU DIDN'T LIE TO ME

JUST TO HELP YOUR COUSIN

NO.

WELL, GOOD...

BECAUSE THERE WERE PLENTY

THAT GOT PASSED
OVER FOR THE JOB.

AYE, 'TIS TRUE.

WHATEVER.

I EVEN TURNED DOWN ME OWN
THREE ADORABLE NEPHEWS.

BUT
UNCLE
KRABS.

THEY SOLVE MYSTERIES.

[CHUCKLES]

NOW GO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF
WHY YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

[MUTTERING]

STANLEY...

I CANNOT KEEP
COVERING FOR... YOU!

[SCREAMS]: NO...

MY SPATULA.

THE THING I HOLD NEAREST

SPONGEBOB, WHAT IN THE NAME

OH, YOU BROKE
YOUR SPATULA.

THAT'S A SHAME.

I'LL ORDER ANOTHER

NO, NO, NO!

IDIDN'T BREAK MY SPATULA.

HEDID.

[HYPERVENTILATING]

HE'S RIGHT [SOBBING].

I RUIN EVERYTHING I TOUCH.

ANOTHER STORY ABOUT A LOST CITY.

WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IT OUT?

[SOBBING]

ENCINO.

[PATRICK LAUGHING]

A BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN, SPONGEBOB.

HURRY, PATRICK, HURRY!

OH.

HOW'S IT LOOK, BUDDY?

READY FOR THE OLD SCRAPBOOK?

MORE LIKE THE SCRAP HEAP.

HM.

THEY NEVER COME OUT RIGHT.

OH, WELL.

LET'S TRY AGAIN.

OK, FRIEND, THIS IS GONNA
BE MY MASTERPIECE.

I'M READY, [CHUCKLING].

HI, PATRICK.

I MISSED IT AGAIN.

THIS DARN CAMERA
ISN'T FAST ENOUGH.

[GRUNTING]

HOLD ON A SECOND, PATRICK.

IT'S NOT THE POOR CAMERA'S FAULT
YOU CAN'T GET A PHOTO.

IT'S NOT?

NO, IT IS THE VERY NATURE
OF THE FRAGILE BUBBLE.

IT IS?

YES, IT IS, MY FRIEND.

ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

THE SUN MUST SET

AT THE END OF EVERY DAY

AND THE CURTAIN MUST FALL

AT THE END OF EVERY PLAY

AND EVERY LITTLE BUBBLE
EVER BLOWN

MUST SOMEDAY POP

LIKE PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS DAY

AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO STAY

OR A CHEESE SOUFFLE

IT DOESN'T LAST ALL DAY

I WILL TRY

AGAIN

Chorus: TRY AGAIN

TO BLOW A BUBBLE

Chorus: TO BLOW A BUBBLE

THAT WILL LAST ALL DAY

Chorus: TRY TO BLOW A BUBBLE

THAT WILL LAST

Man: ALL DAY

SPONGEBOB?

NOT NOW, PATRICK.

THIS BUBBLE IS GONNA
BREAK ALL RECORDS.

WELL, I HOPE IT DOESN'T BREAK
UNTIL WE GET A LITTLE CLOSER
TO THE GROUND.

HUH?

WHAT HAVE I DONE?

[SCREAMING...]

WE'RE NEVER GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE.

[PATRICK SCREAMING]

WHAT HAPPENED?

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

Patrick: WHOA, WHAT IS IT?

IT LOOKS REALLY OLD.

"ANTIS."

WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS, PATRICK?

"ANTIS, ANTIS, SQUAREPANTIS."

PROBABLY BELONGED
TO YOUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS.

SPONGEBOB "SQUAREPANTIS,"
YOU MUST WEAR THE ANCIENT CREST
OF YOUR ANCESTORS

FOR IT IS YOUR BIRTHRIGHT!

MY BIRTHRIGHT!

[GRUNTING]

LET'S TAKE THIS TO
THE BIKINI BOTTOM MUSEUM.

THEY'LL KNOW WHAT IT IS.

[WHISTLING]

UH, BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR STANDING
OUTSIDE A MUSEUM DOING NOTHING.

WHATEVER YOU SAY.

HELLO THERE.

WELCOME TO THE MUSEUM.

THAT'LL BE $3.

BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS FREE TUESDAY.

OH, NO, NO, NO.

TODAY'S MONDAY.

OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE WEARING
THIS "I HATE MONDAYS" SHIRT.

GOOD POINT.

ENJOY THE ARTIFACTS.

DON'T STAND
IN ONE PLACE TOO LONG.

PEOPLE MIGHT MISTAKE
YOU FOR ONE.

[GASPING]

SPONGEBOB.

[LAUGHING]

WHOO, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

NEPTUNE'S ASCENSION,
THE ONLY SURVIVING PAINTING FROM
THE GREAT LOST CITY OF ATLANTIS.

THIS IS JUST WHAT
THE DOCTOR ORDERED, SQUIDDY.

SPENDING YOUR DAY STUDYING
THE ATLANTEAN MASTERS.

AND BEST OF ALL, NO SPONGE...

[LAUGHING]

WOULD YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE...?

WHAT IS THAT?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
THE AMULET OF ATLANTIS?

WE WERE JUST...

WERE YOU GOING TO STEAL IT?

NO, SQUIDWARD, WE'D NEVER...

THIS IS A NEW LOW,
EVEN FOR YOU TWO.

LUCKY FOR YOU, I WAS HERE TODAY.

STEALING ARTIFACTS COULD LAND
YOU IN THE STONY LONES...

[GROANING]

YOU BOOBS FOUND THE MISSING HALF
OF THE ATLANTEAN AMULET.

WHAT'S AN ATLANTEAN OMELET?

AMULET, NOT OMELET.

IT'S THE KEY TO UNTOLD RICHES.

DID SOMEONE SAY UNTOLD RICHES?

YES, EUGENE.

THE STREETS ARE LINED WITH GOLD,
AND THE STREET LAMPS
ARE MADE OF DIAMONDS.

DIAMOND LIGHT BULBS?

I WONDER WHAT THEY MAKE
THE MONEY OUT OF.

FOR REASONS UNKNOWN,
THIS GREAT CITY
DISAPPEARED ONE DAY

BUT NO RUINS WERE EVER FOUND.

ALL THE INVENTIONS YOU TAKE
FOR GRANTED WERE GIVEN TO US
BY THE ATLANTEANS.

THEIR ADVANCES IN ART,
FINANCIAL WEALTH, AND WEAPONRY
WERE EONS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME.

WHY IS THIS BUBBLE
PAINTED ON THE MURAL?

THAT'S JUST
THE OLDEST LIVING BUBBLE.

[GASPING]

THE OLDEST LIVING BUBBLE, ALIVE?

BEHOLD, PATRICK!

THE OLDEST LIVING BUBBLE.

THIS IS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL BUBBLE I'VE EVER SEEN.

THAT'S JUST A PAINTING,
YOU QUARTERWIT.

QUARTERWIT, HAH.

THAT'S LESS THAN HALF.

THE REAL BUBBLE
LIVES IN ATLANTIS.

SOME DUMB OLD BUBBLE PALES
IN COMPARISON TO THE ART.

MONEY.

AND SCIENCE.

DON'T FORGET SCIENCE.

WHAT'S ALL THE HUBBUB, BOYS?

THESE TWO CHOWDERBRAINS FOUND
THE MISSING HALF OF THE AMULET.

THE AMULET OF ATLANTIS?

LEGEND SAYS,
WHEN THE TWO HALVES ARE JOINED,
THE PATH TO ATLANTIS IS OPENED.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING ON?

LET'S HITCH THEM TWO DOGGIES UP.

GO ON, SQUIDWARD.

HURRY UP, SQUIDWARD.

THAT MONEY AIN'T GETTIN'
ANY YOUNGER.

[SQUEALING]

THE MAGICAL PATH TO ATLANTIS
IS A VAN?

NICE HOT ROD FLAMES.

WHAT'S IT DOING?

WELL, POLLYWOLLYDINGDANGDOO.

WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

TAKE A GANDER, Y'ALL.

FABULOUS DECOR.

IT'S QUITE A VESSEL,
BUT WHO'S MANNING IT?

Computer voice: GREETINGS.

WELCOME ABOARD
THE SEA SHIP ATLANTIS.

THIS IS A NONSTOP TRIP,
SO PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT, RELAX,
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

GOOD.

BET THERE'S SOME
LOOSE CHANGE IN HERE.

AH, SO THIS IS WHAT
LUXURY FEELS LIKE.

[SIGHING]

WHAT I WOULDN'T DO
FOR A FOOT RUB.

[LAUGHING]

Computer voice:
ATTENTION, PASSENGERS.

REGRETFULLY, WE LACK THE FUEL
NEEDED FOR FORWARD MOTION.

All: WHAT?

[ALL GRUNTING]

IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

WHERE'S THE GAS TANK?

Computer: WE ATLANTEANS FIND
THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS
TO BE COUNTERINTUITIVE

AND HAVE DEVELOPED
AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE
WE CALL SONG.

HUH?

Computer: THE ENGINE OF
THIS VESSEL IS FUELED BY SONG.

THE MORE YOU SING
OF YOUR DESIRES, THE CLOSER
TO ATLANTIS YOU WILL GET.

LET US COMMENCE SINGING.

DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

NO, BUT I'M GAME
FOR SINGING ANY DAY.

SING

SING A SONG

A SONG OF WANTING
TO MOVE ALONG

TO A LAND
WHERE ALL OUR DREAMS

WHOOPS, SORRY.

TO A LAND
WHERE ALL OUR DREAMS

CAN FINALLY COME TRUE

A BUBBLE I LONG FOR

IT SO ELUDES ME

BUT SOON ENOUGH, I WILL SEE

WELL, THAT'S JUST
SPLENDID, BOY

AND THEN, WE'RE IN BIG MONEY

MORE THAN YOU CAN SPEND

WITH FIVES AND 10s AND 50s

AND I'LL WANT
TO BE YOUR FRIEND

Plankton: [LAUGHING]

SUCH A VALIANT DESIRE

[LAUGHING]

THE LOST WEAPONS OF ATLANTIS

THE MOST ADVANCED
OF ALL TIME

AS SOON AS THIS
DOPEY SONG IS DONE

I PLAN TO MAKE THEM MINE

Sandy: DID YOU ALL
HEAR SOMETHING?

I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THAT THERE'S A LOST CITY

WHERE HAVING SMARTS
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN BEING PRETTY

WITH ALL THEIR
ADVANCED SCIENCE

AND MY PAINFULLY
ENLARGED MIND

I BET WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
TO MAKE WONDROUS THINGS

LIKE MELONS
WITH EDIBLE RINDS

AS A CONNOISSEUR OF FINE ART

I'M PROUD TO SAY

I'VE ALWAYS SEEN THINGS
IN MY OWN SPECIAL WAY

"ARTLANTIS," WITH
THEIR GLORIOUS AESTHETICS

I'LL COP THEIR STYLE,
AND IN A WHILE

MY ART WILL BE PROPHETIC

I'M PATRICK

I'M PATRICK

PATRICK, PATRICK, PATRICK

AND I LIKE...

UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

Computer voice: WARNING:
YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF SONG FUEL.

[SCREAMING]

HEY, LOOK, IT'S ATLANTIS.

SpongeBob: PRETTY.

[SCREAMING]

YOU DIMWITS HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN HERE TWO MINUTES

AND YOU'VE ALREADY MESSED UP
SOMEONE'S TOPIARY GARDEN.

GO ON, SPONGEBOB.

RING THE BELL.

RING FOR THE KING, HUH?

[HORNS BLARING...]

WELCOME TO ATLANTIS.

I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

[GRUNTING...]

ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

I AM THE LORD ROYAL HIGHNESS,
BUT MY FRIENDS CALL ME L.R.H.

MY FRIENDS CALL ME SPONGEBOB.

I'M HERE TO SEE
THE OLDEST BUBBLE.

YES, OF COURSE.

Krabs: WHAT A RIP OFF.

THIS STREET AIN'T GOLD.

OH, IF IT'S GOLD YOU WANT,
YOU'LL FIND IT IN OUR VAULT.

I'M EUGENE.

I LIKE MONEY.

I CAN SEE THAT.

PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

COME, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE GRAND TOUR
OF OUR ATLANTEAN FORTRESS.

I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ALL HERE.

THEY'RE GONE.

NOW TO GET TO THOSE WEAPONS.

[GROANING]

TRAPPED!

OK, WHAT DO I HAVE
TO WORK WITH HERE?

WHAT'S THIS?

OWNERS MANUAL?

LOOKS LIKE I'VE FOUND
MY ESCAPE ROUTE.

[LAUGHING]

[GRUNTING]

OW.

Lord Royal Highness: FOR
CENTURIES, WE ATLANTEANS SPENT

NAY, WASTED OUR TALENTS
AND ENERGY

BUILDING THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY TO
DEFEND OURSELVES FROM INVADERS

BUT WE ABANDONED THE IDEA
OF WARFARE LONG AGO

AND NOW, ALL THESE WEAPONS
GATHER DUST BEHIND
THIS LOCKED DOOR AS AN EXAMPLE

OF WHAT MUST BE DONE
IF ONE WISHES TO LIVE IN HARMONY

WITH ALL CREATURES
OF THIS OR ANY WORLD.

Krabs: [SIGHING],
HARMONY, "SHMARMONY."

WHEN DO WE GET
TO SEE THE TREASURE?

BUT OF COURSE.

FOLLOW ME.

COMING THROUGH, BOYS.

THESE ATLANTEANS LEAVE
A ROOM FULL OF THE MOST
ADVANCED WEAPONRY UNGUARDED?

NO WONDER THEY GOT LOST.

[GRUNTING]

OH, MY.

THERE WILL BE NO ONE
TO STOP ME THIS TIME.

[LAUGHING MANIACALLY...]

[♪...]

WELL, BAD NEWS, KIDS.

ENCINO'S STILL LOST.

[♪...]

OOH, BUT AT LEAST
I GOT ME RADIO FIXED.

WELL, ENJOY
THE REST OF THE SHOW.

Lord Royal Highness: IT IS BOTH
AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE
TO WELCOME YOU TO ATLANTIS.

WE HAVEN'T HAD VISITORS
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

YOU SEE, BEING A LOST CITY
HAS CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES.

BUT I DIGRESS.

NOW, IF YOU WILL JUST FOLLOW ME,
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME
OF OUR GRANDEST ACHIEVEMENTS.

SQUIDWARD, YOU TOLD ME
THE STREETS WERE PAVED
WITH GOLD.

NOW, THAT STREET LIGHT BETTER BE
A 600 CARAT DIAMOND, OR ELSE.

[GROANING]

OH, HOLD STILL, SQUIDWARD.

YOU'RE STANDING ON MY NECK.

OOH, WHAT?

[GLASS BREAKING]

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

YEAH, BUT I FEEL ODD.

[MAKING UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES]

MR. KRABS, ARE YOU OK?

I'D KNOW THAT SMELL ANYWHERE.

[DOGS BARKING]

ME POCKETS!

THEY BE SMELLIN' LOOT.

[SCREAMING]

HEY.

THOSE POCKETS OF YOURS REALLY
HAVE A NOSE FOR TREASURE.

THESE ARE ME
HOUND'STOOTH PANTS.

WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A GLIMPSE
OF ANCIENT ATLANTEAN HISTORY.

LONG AGO, WE ABANDONED
OUR OBSESSION WITH WEALTH

TO FOCUS ON
THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE

SO HELP YOURSELF TO AS MUCH
AS YOUR POCKETS CAN CARRY.

AS MUCH AS ME POCKETS CAN CARRY?

OH...

IF I'D ONLY KNOWN
WHEN I WOKE UP TODAY

I'D HAVE STOPPED
AT ME TAILOR'S ALONG THE WAY

AND HAD 10 MORE POCKETS
PUT ON ME PANTS

'CAUSE I THINK I HEAR
A MONEY AVALANCHE

[YODELING]

LOOK AT ALL THIS CASH, HEY

LOOK AT ALL THIS MONEY

I HOPE ME HEART CAN TAKE IT

[GROANING]

[BEEPING]

CLEAR.

I'M ALL RIGHT, SONNY.

INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS
CAN MAKE QUITE A MESS

UNLESS YOU FALL
INTO A MONEY PRESS

OH, MAKE ME INTO MONEY,
MR. WONDERFUL MACHINE

I ALWAYS KNEW THAT
ME TRUE COLOR WAS GREEN

OH, EVER SINCE
I WAS A LITTLE KID

I DREAMED OF SUCH A PLACE

YES, I DID

WITH MOUNTAINS OF MONEY
AND RIVERS OF CASH

AND A POOL OF COINS
TO MAKE A SPLASH

OH, I'LL OPEN UP A KRUSTY KRAB
WITH PATTIES MADE OF MONEY

THEY'D BE DELICIOUS,
AND EXPENSIVE,
AND TASTE LIKE GOLDEN HONEY

MONEY AND GOLD
AND TREASURE UNTOLD

AND ALL OF IT FOR ME.

Lord Royal Highness: MR. KRABS.

WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE BUBBLE.

WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN US?

ARE YOU KIDDING?

I JUST GOT HERE!

Lord Royal Highness:
VERY WELL, THEN.

OFF WE GO.

SPONGEBOB, WHEN ARE WE
GONNA SEE THE BUBBLE?

PATRICK, SHH.

DON'T DALLY, LADS.

YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
LEFT BEHIND, DO YOU?

NO, SIR.

COME ON ALONG, PATRICK.

YOU KNOW, L.R.H.,
I WAS BORN WITH
A HEALTHY SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY

AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD GET A PEEK AT SOME OF
YOUR SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS.

OF COURSE, MS. CHEEKS.

HERE WE ARE, THE CULMINATION
OF ALL OUR TECHNOLOGY.

I GIVE YOU THE ATLANTEAN HALL
OF SCIENCE.

HOPPIN' ACORNS!

LOOK AT ALL THIS HIGHTECH GEAR!

WHAT DOES THIS GIZMO DO?

IT'S A BIOMASS
CONVERTING DEVICE.

IT CAN TAKE
ANY HOUSEHOLD OBJECT

THIS COMB, FOR EXAMPLE,
AND TURN IT INTO,
SAY, ICE CREAM.

[COW MOOING]

WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO TRY?

Both: ME, ME, ME, ME, ME!

GO AHEAD.

YAY!

[LAUGHING]

[MAKING EATING NOISES]

COMB FLAVORED.

WHAT ELSE CAN IT
TURN THINGS INTO?

ACTUALLY, IT CAN ONLY
TURN THINGS INTO ICE CREAM.

WE HAVEN'T WORKED
THAT BUG OUT YET.

BUT I CAN SHOW YOU THE MOST
AMAZINGSLASHFANTASTIC DEVICE
CREATED BY ATLANTEAN HANDS.

BEHOLD, THIS GRAND MACHINE
ALLOWS THE USER TO BE
BROKEN DOWN TO NANOSTATURE

ENABLING THEM TO BATTLE GERMS
HAND TO HAND.

HOW'S IT WORK?

PLEASE HAVE A SEAT,
AND I'LL EXPLAIN.

NOW, HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

HEY, COOL.

WHERE'D SPONGEBOB GO?

RIGHT NOW, HIS MOLECULES
ARE BEING BROKEN DOWN
INTO DATA

WHICH IS ASSEMBLED
INTO THIS COMPUTER,
AND IS STORED ON THESE TAPES.

THEN, REASSEMBLED ON
A MUCH SMALLER SCALE.

SOMEONE, HELP ME!

AND FINALLY PASSES THROUGH
THIS TUBE AND INTO THIS TANK

WHICH CONTAINS
EVERY ELEMENT KNOWN TO...

OH, DEAR HEAVENS,
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR SCIENTISTS

WERE WORKING ON
A VERY AGGRESSIVE CASE
OF THE SNIFFLES.

HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

DON'T WORRY, SPONGEBOB.

I'M COMING TO HELP YOU.

OK, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

LET ME OUT OF THIS THING!

[VIDEO GAME MUSIC PLAYS...]

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

OH, NO.

[SCREAMING]

SQUIDWARD, DON'T MAKE
ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.

HELP!

[SCREAMING]

All: HELP, SANDY!

SOUNDS LIKE THEM CRITTERS
IS IN TROUBLE.

HOLD ON, FELLOWS!

I'LL BE THERE SOON,
AS SOON AS I SEND THESE CRITTERS
TO THEIR DOOM.

LOOK OUT, GERMS

THE END IS NEAR

YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED

'CAUSE SANDY'S HERE

I'LL GET THESE GERMS

AND MAKE 'EM PAY

WITH SOME GOOD
OLDFASHIONED KARATE

HIYA!

IF I BORROW SOME ELEMENTS
FROM THE PERIODIC TABLE

I CAN MIX UP A BREW
THAT IS SURE TO DISABLE

ANY VIRUS, BUG, OR SNIFFLE
THAT STEPS INTO MY PATH

AND MAKE THEM FEEL
MY MICROSCOPIC WRATH

HIYA!

WELL, SHALL WE CONTINUE ON
WITH THE REST OF THE TOUR?

Y'ALL HEAD OUT WITHOUT ME.

WELL, THEN, GOOD LUCK.

HAVE FUN.

WE'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER.

YOUR FRIEND SANDY CERTAINLY
IS AN EXCITABLE ONE.

QUITE.

SOMEHOW, I KNEW I'D GET STUCK
WITH YOU YAHOOS THE LONGEST.

[PLANKTON LAUGHING]

OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT

WEAPONS AS FAR AS
THE EYE CAN SEE

BUT WHICH ONE
WILL BE RIGHT FOR ME?

HOW DO I PICK?

WHICH ONE WILL DO THE TRICK?

WHICH IS BEST
TO GUARANTEE ETERNAL REST?

SO MANY WEAPONS,
HOW DO I CHOOSE?

LOOK AT THIS ONE,
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FUSE

AND WITH THIS ONE,
I COULDN'T LOSE

THAT ONE WOULD SURELY
GIVE THEM THE BLUES

AND THIS ONE HERE
MATCHES MY SHOES

COME ON, PLANKTON,
JUST PICK ONE

AND FORGET ABOUT YOUR SHOES

EENY, MEENY, MINY, MOE

I PICK YOU, NOW LET'S GO

THIS STUFF IS WONDERFUL AND ALL,
BUT WHEN ARE WE GONNA SEE
SOME REAL ATLANTEAN CULTURE?

GENTLEMEN, WHAT IS ART?

OH, OH, I KNOW, I KNOW!

I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

ART IS THE CONSCIOUS ARRANGEMENT
OF ELEMENTS IN A MATTER
THAT AFFECTS A SENSE OF BEAUTY.

Lord Royal Highness:
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

ART IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LEARN TO DREAM.

GO AHEAD.

DREAM A LITTLE.

IT LOOKS LIKE MY FRONT DOOR.

BEHOLD, THE HALL OF ARTS.

INCREDIBLE.

[WHIMPERING]

THE CREATIVITY.

THE ARTISTRY.

THIS PAINTING IS SO REALISTIC.

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD
STEP STRAIGHT INTO IT.

AND YOU CAN.

[SCREAMING]

WHOA.

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

ISN'T THIS GREAT?

ISN'T THIS NEAT?

I'M A LIVING WORK OF ART

FROM MY HEAD TO MY FEET

FROM THE VERY FIRST DRAWINGS
ON WALLS IN CAVES

ART HAS BEEN WHAT
THE HEART AND SOUL CRAVES

SO PICK UP A BRUSH,
A PENCIL, OR PEN

IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS ONE,
PAINT IT AGAIN

FROM NOW ON,
PLEASE CALL ME "SIR REAL"

I CAN WAIT FOR YOUR IMPRESSION
TO CONGEAL

TAKE IT FROM
AN UNDERSEA RENAISSANCE MAN

I'D EVEN LOOK GREAT
ON THE SIDE OF YOUR VAN

ANY WAY YOU CARVE IT

I AM ART, AND ART IS ME

ASK YOUR MAMA OR YOUR DADA
TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THE, UH, SCHISM

BETWEEN MINIMALISM
AND CUBISM

MY PERSONALITY MAY BE OF
THE CYNICAL TYPE

BUT I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING
THAT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE

I CAN SAY HONESTLY,
AND WITH GREAT CERTAINTY

THAT ATLANTIS IS WHERE
I WANT TO SPEND ETERNITY...

HEY, CAN YOU NOT SING?

I'M TRYING TO MODEL HERE.

NOW, HOLD ON, NANDO.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE FIVE?

I'M REALLY DIGGING
THIS SQUID'S FORM.

[SIGHING]

LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE HERE
INSPIRING THESE ATLANTEAN
ART MAKERS WITH MY BEAUTY.

YOU GUYS, GO ON AHEAD.

OK, BYE, SQUIDWARD.

NOW, THIS SECTION OF TOWN
IS KNOWN FOR ITS ADVANCES
IN THE SCIENCE OF FONDUE CREAM.

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

THIS TOUR'S BEEN GREAT AND ALL,
BUT, UH, CAN WE SEE
THE BUBBLE NOW?

DO EXCUSE ME.

MOST FOLKS DON'T STAY
WITH THE TOUR THIS LONG.

OF COURSE YOU CAN.

BUT FIRST, REMEMBER THIS.

THIS BUBBLE IS OVER
ONE MILLION YEARS OLD.

IT WAS BROUGHT HERE
WHEN THE FIRST ATLANTEANS
COLONIZED THIS PLACE

DEFTLY HANDCARRIED
OVER BILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS
FROM OUR HOME PLANET.

IT IS OUR PEOPLE'S MOST BELOVED
AND TREASURED ANCIENT RELIC.

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
REMEMBER TO...

HAVE FUN.

[GASPING]

THERE IT IS, PATRICK.

THE WORLD'S
OLDEST LIVING BUBBLE.

WHOO!

[WHIMPERING]

LOOK AT IT, PATRICK.

SO ANCIENT, SO FLOATY.

IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,
WRINKLEDUP, DUSTY OLD BUBBLE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

LIKE A DELICATE AIR RAISIN.

NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I NEED TO MAKE READY
FOR TONIGHT'S DINNER

SO I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE
YOU TWO FRIENDLY STRANGERS ALONE

WITH OUR MOST BELOVED ANCIENT
AND FRAGILE ATLANTEAN RELIC.

JOIN US IN THE DINING HALL
WHEN YOU'VE HAD AN EYEFUL.

THANK YOU,
MR. LORD ROYAL HIGHNESS, SIR.

JUST LOOK AT IT, PATRICK.

AH, THE STORIES
THIS BUBBLE COULD TELL.

I JUST WISH WE COULD GET
A CLOSER LOOK.

OH...

PATRICK, CATCH THE...!

OH, GOLLY!

[GROANING]

I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN HOLD THIS!

[GROANING]

WHOA!

[GASPING]

[WHIMPERING]

[LAUGHING]

WHOO, THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE, BUDDY.

YEAH, WE ALMOST POPPED
THE MOST PRIZED POSSESSION
OF ALL ATLANTIS.

[LAUGHING]

BOY, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
OUR GREATEST BLUNDER,
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

WE SHOULD GO BEFORE
SOMETHING BAD DOES HAPPEN.

LET'S GET A PICTURE FOR
OUR SCRAPBOOKS BEFORE WE LEAVE.

GREAT IDEA, PATRICK.

CHEESE.

PATRICK, DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

UH, SORT OF A POPPING SOUND?

MMHMM.

[SCREAMING]

SO SORRY I'M LATE.

THE TOUR RAN A LITTLE LONG.

SO, HOW ARE YOU ALL ENJOYING
OUR BELOVED CITY?

I'M NEVER LEAVING THIS PLACE.

I'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT PAINTING
IN A FEW HOURS HERE

THAN I DID IN FOUR YEARS
OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS.

AND, EUGENE, I ASSUME
THE HALL OF TREASURE
WAS EVERYTHING YOU HOPED FOR?

[STAMMERING]

AND, SANDRA, HOW DID YOU FIND
OUR LABORATORIES?

THEY ARE JUST AMAZING.

I USED YOUR INVENTION ROOM
TO MAKE THIS.

SPLENDID.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

I'LL SHOW YOU.

[BELCHING]

NOW I CAN EAT UNDERWATER
WITHOUT REMOVING MY HELMET.

THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

I SHOULD HAVE A CURE
FOR THE COMMON COLD

UP AND RUNNING
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON
WITH YOUR HIGHTECH LAB.

[WHIMPERING]

SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, TELL ME,
HOW DID YOU ENJOY OUR RAREST
AND MOST PRIZED POSSESSION?

UM, WE HAVE TO GO BACK
TO BIKINI BOTTOM NOW.

HUH?

HUH?

[LAUGHING]

COME, ENJOY THE BEST
ATLANTEAN CUISINE HAS TO OFFER
BEFORE YOU GO.

[WHIMPERING]

WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TWO MORONS?

WE HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE
A PARADISE LIKE ATLANTIS?

BECAUSE, UH, GARY MISSES ME.

WE DESTROYED
YOUR MOST PRIZED POSSESSION!

[LAUGHING]

IF THERE'S ONE THING
WE ATLANTEANS ENJOY, IT'S
A HEALTHY DOSE OF DARK HUMOR.

[CHUCKLING]

IT'S NOT A JOKE.

WE BURST THE BUBBLE!

[GASPING]

[LAUGHING]

THAT'S NOT THE REAL BUBBLE.

IT'S JUST A PROP
FOR THE TOURISTS.

THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.

OOH.

[GROWLING]

SUMMON THE
ATLANTEAN ROYAL GUARD.

[SCREAMING]

[WHIMPERING]

SEIZE THESE
HOSTILE BUBBLEPOPPERS.

[SCREAMING]

DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

MOVE!

CAN'T YOU GO ANY FASTER, SANDY?

MAYBE, IF Y'ALL
WOULD USE YOUR FEET.

NEVER MIND.

JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

[SIGHING]

HUH?

[PATRICK GRUNTING]

COME ON, PATRICK.

[LAUGHING]

THAT TICKLES.

[LAUGHING]

HANG IN THERE, LITTLE BUDDY.

[GRUNTING...]

HUH?

DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY.

[GRUNTING]

[PLANKTON LAUGHING]

[SIGHING]

THIS IS THE END OF PATCHY.

NO WATER, NO FOOD,
AND STILL NO ENCINO.

HERE COME THE VULTURES
TO PICK ME BONES.

[GASPING]

SHIVER ME TIMBERS, IT'S POTTY.

I WONDER WHAT PARROT
TASTES LIKE.

[SQUAWKING]

COME BACK HERE.

UHOH, HERE COME
THE HALLUCINATIONS.

[COUGHING]

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHING]

PATCHY, IT'S ME,
SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS.

[LAUGHING]

DON'T LOSE HOPE.

EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT,
WHEN YOU GET TO ENCINO.

BUT ENCINO IS GONE.

IT'S NOT GONE, IF YOU BELIEVE.

BELIEVE... BELIEVE.

[FOGHORN BLOWING]

[GASPING]

WELCOME TO ENCINO.

IT'S BACK.

SPONGEBOB WAS RIGHT.

ALL I HAD TO DO WAS BELIEVE.

[LAUGHING]

Man: WAS OUT OF SIGHT

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

I'M BACK IN ENCINO

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

AND EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT

THE SKY ABOVE
AND GROUND BELOW

BRING ME BACK IN ENCINO

IT WAS LOST SOME TIME AGO

JUST GLAD TO BE BACK HOME

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

I'M BACK IN ENCINO

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

I'M BACK IN ENCINO

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

AND EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT

[BABY CRYING...]

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

I'M BACK IN ENCINO

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE

I'M BACK IN ENCINO

YOU GOT...

[MUSIC ENDS]

[EERIE SOUNDS GROW LOUDER]

OW, OW, OW, OW!

OH... IT WAS ALL
A HALLUCINATION.

ENCINO'S STILL GONE.

[GROANING]

OOH, A SANDWICH.

POTTY, YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER.

[MUMBLING]

OH!

POTTY, YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE MAYO!

[GRUNTING]

HERE, YOU WANT SOME?

GO ON.

UH, TAKE IT.

I DON'T LIKE THE MAYONNAISE,
YOU KNOW.

ONCE IT GETS UP ABOVE 130, 135,
THE MAYONNAISE GETS
KIND OF GRODY, YOU KNOW.

[PLANKTON LAUGHING]

COWER TO ME, FOOLS.

I HAVE COMMANDEERED
THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON
IN THE ATLANTEAN ARSENAL.

NOW, BOW BEFORE
THE NEW KING OF ATLANTIS.

THEN, PREPARE TO TASTE MY WRATH.

[GRUNTING]

HUH?

UH, I MEAN, PREPARE
TO TASTE MY WRATH.

[GRUNTING]

YOU...

[GRUNTING]

PREPARE TO TASTE MY WRATH.

[GRUNTING]

Computer voice: LAUNCH
SEQUENCE DEPLOYED.

[PLANKTON LAUGHING]

[GASPING]

[PLANKTON LAUGHING]

[COW MOOING]

OOH!

[MAKING EATING NOISES]

PLANKTON'S WRATH
TASTES LIKE ICE CREAM.

THANKS, PLANKTON.

Plankton: ICE CREAM?

IT SHOOTS ICE CREAM?

[MAKING EATING NOISES]

OVERSIZED ICE CREAM MAKER!

[SCREAMING]

OUCH, OUCH.

LOOK, A TALKING SPECK.

THIS TALKING SPECK WILL MAKE
A FANTASTIC REPLACEMENT

FOR OUR RECENTLY DEFLATED
NATIONAL TREASURE.

WON'T YOU, LITTLE FELLOW?

I'LL DESTROY ALL OF YOU!

AMAZING.

THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT DUSTY OLD BUBBLE.

YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF ME.

WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
I'LL HUNT YOU ALL DOWN
LIKE A PACK OF...

HEY.

CAN'T YOU READ?

NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY.

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]

SO NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.

I HOPE YOU HAVE
A SAFE JOURNEY BACK HOME,
AND DO COME BACK ANY TIME.

SO LONG.

AND THANKS FOR THE TOUR.

DISPOSE OF THIS, QUICKLY.

WE CAN'T SURVIVE
ANY MORE VISITORS LIKE THESE.

SIR, YES, SIR.

[GRUNTING]

I THOUGHT SPONGES WERE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE LIFE EASIER.

GOODBYE, ATLANTIS

BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO GO

BACK TO A LITTLE TOWN

THAT IS THE GREATEST PLACE
I KNOW

BACK TO BIKINI BOTTOM

I CAN HARDLY WAIT

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TREASURE?

IT WAS REALLY GREAT

I LOVE BIKINI BOTTOM

IT'S WHERE MY GARY IS

BUT ATLANTIS HAD
THAT SCIENCE STUFF,
AT WHICH I WAS A WIZ

SOON, I'LL SEE
THE KRUSTY KRAB

WHERE I'M HAPPILY EMPLOYED

BUT ATLANTIS HAD
THE OLDEST BUBBLE

WHICH I CRUELLY DESTROYED

YOU CAN'T BEAT BIKINI BOTTOM

NO PLACE IS SO NICE

BUT ATLANTIS WAS
A FABULOUS ARTISTIC PARADISE

SORRY, SQUIDWARD,
BUT IT'S THE END
OF OUR ATLANTEAN VACATION

AND BACK TO MY DEPRESSING LIFE
OF QUIET DESPERATION

SpongeBob: GOODBYE, ATLANTIS

WE'RE BIKINI BOTTOM BOUND

PLEASE TURN THIS BUS AROUND

WE HAD OUR FUN

WE SURE DID

BUT NOW WE'RE DONE

AND I'M BUMMED

WE'RE ON OUR WAY

CAN'T WE STAY?

SO NOW WE SAY GOODBYE

I THINK I'M GONNA CRY

Patrick: ME, TOO

SpongeBob: GOODBYE, ATLANTIS

[PATRICK CRYING]

WE'RE BIKINI BOTTOM BOUND

THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME

Krabs: THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE ATLANTIS

SpongeBob: I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET HOME

Krabs: I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK

SpongeBob: WE'RE
BIKINI BOTTOM BOUND

Sandy: PLEASE DON'T
MAKE US LEAVE

SpongeBob: WE'RE
BIKINI BOTTOM BOUND

Squidward: STOP SAYING THAT.

SpongeBob: I EVEN LOVE
THE SOUND

All: GOODBYE, ATLANTIS

SpongeBob: BIKINI BOTTOM
IS THE GREATEST PLACE TO BE

All: GOODBYE, ATLANTIS.

[SINGING FADES]

PRETTY GOOD STORY, EH, KIDS?

[GLASS BREAKING]

I FOUND ENCINO.

BUT IT'S ALL TINY.

SOMEONE MUST HAVE... [GASPING].

[SCREAMING]

SORRY, SIR.

OUR SON, NORBLOCK FIVE,
WAS MESSING AROUND
WITH THE "SHRINKATRON" AGAIN.

NO, NO, NO, NO.

I WANT ENCINO FULLSIZE AGAIN.

THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME.

THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME.

OK, HAND IT OVER, NORBLOCK FIVE.

WE'LL FIX YOUR TOWN, BEARDY.

GREAT UNCLE PATRICK REVERE.

HE RODE THROUGH THE STREETS

WARNING BIKINI BOTTOM
OF THE COMING HORDES

OF RAVENOUS MANEATING MOLLUSKS.

Patrick Revere:

THE MOLLUSKS ARE COMING.

Patrick: IT'S TOO BAD NOBODY
LISTENED TO HIM.

WHAT BEITH THE DEAL
WITH YE OLD NUT CASE?

[SCREAMING]

[SNAPPING]

WOW, PATRICK, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A FAMOUS RELATIVE?

WELL, THE BEST
PART ABOUT IT IS

I DON'T HAVE TO
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN LIFE

BECAUSE MY UNCLE
ALREADY DID IT FOR ME.

REALLY TAKES
THE OLD PRESSURE OFF.

THAT'S NOTHING.

MY GREATGREATGRANDPAPPY KRABS

INVENTED THE GREATEST
THING SINCE LOOSE CHANGE:

THE SPENDTHRIFT BILLFOLD SYSTEM.

ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

HEY, SPONGEBOB,
HOW 'BOUT A RAISE?

GEE, THANKS, MR. KRABS.

UHUHUH... WATCH.

AH! SEE?

DOESN'T THAT HURT?

EVERY TIME.

GOSH, I DON'T HAVE
ANYONE FAMOUS IN MYFAMILY.

OH, WELL, THEN IT'S LUCKY
YOU HAVE ME AS A FAMOUS FRIEND

OR YOUR LIFE WOULD
BE A HOLLOW SHELL.

I'LL BET YOUR SOMEBODY'S FAMOUS
POOPCOVERED ANCESTOR.

[SIGHS]

I NEVER REALIZED HOW SAD
AND EMPTY MY LIFE WAS

UNTIL MY FRIENDS POINTED IT OUT.

HIYAH!

HI, SANDY.

SOMETHING WRONG, SPONGEBOB?

YOU LOOK SADDER THAN
A BULL FROG FULL OF SODAPOP.

DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMOUS
RELATIVES, SANDY?

I SURE DO.

MY GREATAUNT ROSY CHEEKS

WAS THE FIRST SQUIRREL
TO DISCOVER OIL

AT SPINDLETOP, TEXAS.

Man: SHE'S READY TO BLOW!

SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IN TOWN
HAS A FAMOUS RELATIVE.

EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME.

COME ON, I BET Y'ALL GOT SOMEONE
FAMOUS IN YOUR FAMILY TREE.

WELL, THERE WAS MY UNCLE SHERM.

HE COULD STICK AN ENTIRE
WATERMELON UP HIS NOSE.

THAT'S NOT THE
KIND OF FAMOUS I MEAN.

COME ON, LET'S DO A LITTLE
DIGGING AROUND YOUR FAMILY TREE.

Sandy: "FAMILY HISTORIES
OF BIKINI BOTTOM."

LET'S SEE, SQUAREHEAD,
SQUARESHIRT, SQUAREPANTS...

HEY, LOOK IT HERE...

[GASPS]: IT'S A STATUE OF
SPONGEBUCK SQUAREPANTS.

Spongebob: I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF HIM.

HE GOT HIS OWN STATUTE?

SAYS HERE, HE SAVED THE ENTIRE
TOWN OF DEAD EYE GULCH.

Sandy: THAT'S WHAT
BIKINI BOTTOM WAS KNOWN AS
BACK IN THE OLD WEST DAYS.

[GUNSHOT]

...IT WAS A TOWN
THAT LIVED UNDER THE TYRANNY
OF A NASTY CROOK

TILL A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER
CAME TO TOWN.

[TRAIN WHISTLE]

WOW... THE BIG CITY.

WELL, TIME TO MAKE MY FORTUNE.

Sandy: BACK IN THEM DAYS

THE WHOLE PLACE WAS RUN BY THAT
NOGOOD GALOOT, DEAD EYE.

WHEWWEE!

THIS PLACE SURE
IS BIG AND FANCYLIKE.

GEE WHILLIKERS, THEY GOT
AN ICE DREAM PARLOR.

I'LL TAKE ONE SCOOP OF
"VANILLI" ICE CREAM, PLEASE.

YOU'RE NEW HERE,
AREN'T YOU?

LOOK OUT TAPEWORM HERE IT COMES.

GET READY, "TAPEY."

[LAUGHS]

WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
DEAD EYE GULCH, STRANGER?

STRANGE IS RIGHT.

THE NAME'S SPONGEBUCK.

I LEFT HOME TO MAKE
MY WAY HERE IN THE BIG CITY.

I'M HERE FOR THE JOB.

WONDERFUL, YOU'RE HIRED.

HEY, EVERYBODY...

MEET OUR NEW SHERIFF.

[WHOOPING AND CHEERING]

SHERIFF?
I'M NOT HERE FOR
THE SHERIFF JOB.

I'M HERE FOR THE FRY COOK JOB.

BACK HOME, I'M KNOWN FOR MY

ROOTIN', TOOTIN',
NEVER PUTTIN' CHILI...

...THE SPICIEST CHILI
WEST OF THE OLD RED BARN.

[AUDIBLE SPIT] YECH!

NO OFFENSE, KID, BUT YOUR
CHILI TASTES TERRIBLE.

IN A GOOD WAY?

NO, IN A TERRIBLE WAY.

LOOK, WE ALREADY GAVE
YOU THE BADGE.

AND THE LAW OF THE WEST SAYS,
"NO TAKEBACKS."

SINCE WHEN?

SINCE... [MUTTERING]

SO THAT MEANS,
YOU'RE THE NEW SHERIFF.

WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OLD SHERIFF?

Krabs: UH, HE'S AT BOOT HILL.

[BIRD CAWS]

AND WHY IS HE AT BOOT HILL?

Krabs: BECAUSE OLD DEAD TREE
HILL WAS TOTALLY FULL.

HE'S ACOMING...
DEAD EYE'S ACOMING.

All: DEAD EYE!

DEAD EYE?

WHO'S DEAD EYE?

I'LL TELL YOU
WHO DEAD EYE IS.

BUT I SHALL DO IT...

THROUGH SONG.

I'M HERE FOR MY...
MONEY, KRABS.

HEHHEH, WHAT?

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP
THE DEED TO ME SALOON

WHEN YOU KEEP TAKING OUT ME
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS?

I'M GOING BROKE HERE.

THAT'S THE IDEA [LAUGHS].

I THOUGHT WE WERE
ALL CLEAR ON THAT.

OH, YEAH

I'LL BE BACK AT
HIGH NOON TOMORROW
FOR THE DEED.

HEY... THAT'S
NOT YOUR MONEY.

WHO SAID THAT?

WELL, LAST TIME I CHECKED

THIS TOWN WAS
DEAD EYE GULCH.

[LAUGHING]

HEHHEH, HEH.

WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY?

I'M SPONGEBUCK,
THE NEW SHERIFF.

WANT SOME CHILI.

SHERIFF?

'ROUND THESE PARTS,
WE CALL 'EM COFFIN JOCKEYS.

COFFIN JOCKEY?

YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

THAT MUST BE A NEW RECORD
FOR RUNNING OFF A SHERIFF.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

HOPE I HAVEN'T MISSED
THE FIRST POST.

WHOA, GIRL.

[HORSE WHINNIES]

WHERE DO YOU GET THESE GUYS?

ALL RIGHT, KID, I'M GONNA
MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOU.

I'M A VILLAIN... GOT IT?

[SHATTERING CLINKS]

I'M SORRY, OLD PAINT.

GUESS I'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU

SO LONG, OLD FRIEND!

HEY, BUDDY,

[PATRICK GUFFAWS]

OH, HEY, SPONGEBUCK.

THOSE GUYS ARE
BARREL OF LAUGHS, HUH?

BUT LAZY.

WELL, ANYWAY, YOU GOTTA GET BACK

I AIN'T NO SHERIFF OR FRY COOK

OR EVEN COFFIN JOCKEY.

AND I'M NO MATCH
FOR DEAD EYE PLANKTON.

I'M NOTHIN'.

[CRACK]

OUT WEST A MAN GETS
RIGHT BACK UP ON HIS COFFIN

AND FACES HIS PROBLEMS
WITH THE HELP

OF HIS IDIOT SIDEKICK FRIEND.

THAT'S ME.

DUH...

I DON'T KNOW... OH!

OK, OK, I'LL DO IT,
JUST STOP HURTING ME.

BESIDES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

IT'S TIME I STEPPED UP AND
LOOKED FATE IN THE EYE.

SO I'LL GO BACK TO
DEAD EYE GULCH, WHIP PLANKTON

AND SAVE THE TOWN AT HIGH NOON.

HOP ON, BUDDY.

THANKS, IDIOT FRIEND.

BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'LL EVER GET BACK

TO DEAD EYE GULCH BY HIGH NOON.

DON'T WORRY,
I GOT A SHORTCUT.

HEEYAW!

[BOTH SCREAM]

[SCREAMING CONTINUES]

[PAINED YELLING]

WHY ARE WE GOING SO FAST?

'CAUSE WITHOUT A SHERIFF

DEAD EYE WON'T STOP TILL HE
HAS THE CLOTHES OFF OUR BACKS.

[WHIP CRACKS]

[MENACING LAUGH]

GREAT IDEA.

[BIRD CAWS]

Dead Eye: OK, LET'S SEE...

PERSONAL POSSESSIONS,
CLOTHES OFF YOUR BACKS?

THAT SHOULD ABOUT DO IT.

LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA GO DROP OFF
ALL MY NEW STUFF AT THE BANK.

I'LL BE BACK AT HIGH NOON TO RUB
MY VICTORY IN YOUR FACE

WITH A LITTLE DANCE.

AHHA, WHA, WHA

AHHA, WHA, WHA

I GOTTA ADMIT,
HE'S GOT SKILLS.

THAT'S RIGHT.

AND AT NOON WHEN I TAKE
THE DEED TO YOUR SALOON, KRABS

I'LL OWN EVERY BUILDING IN TOWN.

AND YOU'LL ALL HAVE
TO WORK FOR ME

THE REST OF YOUR
MISERABLE LIVES.

[LAUGHING]

[CHOKING... COUGHS]

[GASPS]: SWALLOWED A BUG.

I HATE THAT.

IT TOTALLY RUINS AN EVIL LAUGH.

YEEHAW!

[HORSES NEIGH]

I GUESS THAT'S IT.

WE LOST.

I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
COULD GET ANY WORSE.

[SCREAMING DESCENDING]

HOWDY, GUYS
I'M BACK IN THE NICK OF TIME.

WE'RE HEROES.

YOU'RE MORONS.

IT'S TOO LATE.

PLANKTON'S TAKEN EVERYTHING.

BUT IT'S ONLY 11:55.

THE FINAL SHOWDOWN ALWAYS
TAKES PLACE AT HIGH NOON.

WELL, I GUESS THE EARLY BIRD
GETS THE WORM.

AND ALL OUR STUFF.

AND ME MONEY [SNIFFLES].

ME BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL MONEY.

YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

BEFORE I CAME HERE,
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP TOO.

BUT IN THE SHORT
20 MINUTES I'VE KNOWN YOU

I'VE COME TO LOVE
DEAD EYE GULCH.

WOULD YOU GET TO THE POINT
WE'RE FREEZING.

WHAT I'MA SAYIN' IS

IF WE ALL TEAM UP TOGETHER

WE CAN STAND UP
TO DEAD EYE PLANKTON

AND RUN HIM RIGHT OUT OF
DEAD EYE GULCH FOR GOOD.

SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WELL, I THINK WE ALL
KNOW THE ANSWER.

All: FORGET IT,
SPONGEBUCK.

WHAT ARE Y'ALL STANDING
IN YOUR PAJAMAS?

NO, DON'T TELL ME.

OH, I KNOW, YOU'RE
THROWING A SLUMBER PARTY.

PILLOW FIGHT, OH!

[GUFFAWS]

AH!

THAT PILLOW SURE
PACKS A WALLOP.

IT'S MADE OUT OF WOOD

LIKE ALL PILLOWS
IN THE OLD WEST.

ROUND TWO?

I DO BELIEVE I'LL
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, KID.

[GRUNTING]

COME ON, GUYS,
WE CANDO THIS

IF WE WORK TOGETHER.

NO OFFENSE, KID, BUT YOUR ADVICE
IS AS TERRIBLE AS YOUR CHILI.

I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR LOSING FAITH.

I LOST FAITH, TOO.

BUT THEN I DISCOVERED THE LOVE
OF MY NEW IDIOT FRIEND

AND TOGETHER WE'VE COME FAR.

SO I'M SURE WITH ALL
OF US WORKING TOGETHER
IN IDIOT FRIENDSHIP

WE CAN BEAT DEAD EYE
AND SAVE THE TOWN.

SO LET'S HUDDLE UP
AND MAKE A PLAN... TOGETHER.

[SPONGEBUCK WHISPERING]

UHHUH.

[SPONGEBUCK WHISPERING]

UHHUH,

YOU MUST'VE LOST YOUR MEMORY
WHEN YOU HIT YOUR HEAD.

YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO COME BACK
WITH US TO BIKINI BOTTOM.

REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER.

THAT'S IT.

FINALLY, VICTORY WILLBE MINE.

I'LL TURN EUGENE KRABS
INTO A POWERLESS...

BABY.

OOH, A PENNY.

A TRAIL OF PENNIES.

[SNIFFING...]

OOH...

[EVIL LAUGH]

I'VE DONE IT.

NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW.

MY GOO GOO GAS
WILL TRANSFORM KRABS

INTO A TINY, HELPLESS INFANT.

THE KEY TO THE KRUSTY KRAB.

THIS WAS EASIER THAN I HOPED.

[BABY TALK]

HMM.

HE'S A LITTLE BIGGER
THAN I IMAGINED.

SHINY... [GIGGLES]

Plankton: WHOA!

NO, NO!

AH, AH, AHH!

OOF!

WHOA!

[BABY TALK]

HEY, A BABY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
HERE ALL ALONE, BABY?

I'LL TAKE CHARGE OF YOU
UNTIL YOUR MOMMY SHOWS UP.

[BABY LAUGH]

OH, AREN'T YOU JUST TOO CUTE.

COOCHIECOOCHIECOO.

[BOTH LAUGH]

Plankton: HELLO...

IF YOU'RE DONE MAKING
A TOTAL FOOL OUT OF YOURSELF

I COULD USE SOME HELP
WITH THIS LOCK.

OH, SURE THING, PLANKTON.

THERE YOU GO LITTLE GUY.

YES.

MY PLAN IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

NOW THAT I'VE TURNED KRABS
INTO A HELPLESS BABY

THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA
WILL BE MINE.

[LAUGHS]

EH?

HELLO.

POLICE, POLICE!

Plankton: FOOLS...

YOU'LL NEVER HOLD ME.

THESE PRIMITIVE SHACKLES
ARE NO MATCH FOR MY GENIUS.

THAT WAS EASY.

Plankton: I'M FREE.

FREE...

OH, SQUIDWARD.

THANK NEPTUNE, YOU'RE HERE.

I FOUND THIS BABY ALL ALONE.

BUT HE WASN'T REALLY ALONE,
HE WAS WITH PLANKTON

AND HE'S NOT A BABY.

IT'S MR. KRABS.

PLANKTON TURNED HIM
INTO AN INFANT SO HE COULD
STEAL THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA.

[LOUD BELCH]

WHAT DO WE DO, SQUIDWARD?

DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M GOING
ON MY COFFEE BREAK.

A VERY LONG COFFEE BREAK.

AND THEN THAT BLASTED
SPONGE CALLED THE COPS.

THAT'S JUST NOT CRICKET.

NOW I'LL NEVER BE
A TYRANNICAL OVERLORD.

Karen: DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU
HOW TO DO EVERYTHING?

NEXT TIME SPRAY SPONGEBOB, TOO.

NOT SURE
I FOLLOW YOU.

LISTEN CAREFULLY.

SPRAY...

YES.

SPONGE...

UHHUH.

BOB...

RIGHT.

TOO.

NOW YOU'RE JUST
TALKING GIBBERISH.

WHAT I REALLY NEED IS TO

SPRAY MR. KRABS AND SPONGEBOB.

AHH, THAT'S JUST WHAT...

I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANYMORE

OF YOUR LOONY SCHEMES, KAREN.

I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

[FUSSING]
AW, WHAT'S WRONG
MR. BABY KRABS?

ARE YOU THIRSTY?

THAT'S IT, DRINK UP.

[WHINING CRY]

OK, MAYBE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

HOW ABOUT A NICE
HOT KRABBY PATTY?

[CRYING]

YIKES, NOT EVEN
A KRABBY PATTY HELPS.

HOW 'BOUT A STACK OF $20s?

"HEE..."

[MUTTERING]

Plankton: HANDS IN THE AIR.

[GASPS]: PLANKTON.

THAT'S RIGHT, SPONGEBOB,
I'M BACK.

AND YOU WON'T STOP ME THIS TIME.

WHAT?

SPONGEBOB'S A BABY
BUT KRABS IS BACK TO NORMAL?

IT SEEMS A SECOND DOSE
ACTS AS AN ANTIDOTE.

ONE SQUIRT EQUALS BABY.

TWO SQUIRTS EQUALS ADULT.

OR IS IT THREE SQUIRTS FOR BABY

AND FOUR SQUIRTS FOR ADULTS?

BARNACLES,
I'VE RUN OUT OF GAS.

AHEM...

KRABS!

NICE DIAPER.

Plankton: HOLD ON, HOLD ON,
I THINK I...

YES, I'VE GOT IT.

THERE'D BETTER BE SOMETHING
OTHER THAN BILLS IN HERE.

PLANKTON.

PEEKABOO.

[PLANKTON LAUGHS]AHH!

I CAN'T TOLERATE

YOUR STINKY GAS.

[FLATULENCE]

THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

I DON'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE.
[SLURPING]

YOU'LL NEVER
CATCH ME, PLANKTON.

NEVER.

OOH, ANOTHER PENNY.

COME TO PAPA.

NOW WHAT WERE WE DOING?

THIS.

[COUGHING...]

WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY?

YOU GONNA CRY?

WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED TO YOU?

THIS ISN'T BABY GAS.

IT'S SENIOR CITIZEN SPRAY.

EH, WHAT WAS THAT, SONNY?

OUT OF MY WAY, METHUSELAH.

YOU'RE OLD AND USELESS.

HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

OLD PEOPLE ARE OUR GREATEST
NATURAL RESOURCE.

I SALUTE YOU, ELDER CITIZENRY.

I'M GETTING OLD
LISTENING TO THIS.

LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

I REMEMBER WHEN A QUARTER
USED TO COST A NICKEL.

[LAUGHING]

THIS BABY GAS IS WORTHLESS...

AT LEAST YOU'RE WAY TOO OLD

TO STOP ME FROM STEALING
A KRABBY PATTY.

WHAT WAS THAT, SONNY?

IT'LL TAKE MORE TIME TO EXPLAIN
THAN YOU HAVE LEFT.

WHAT?

[PLANKTON LAUGHS]

HE'S GOT THE KRABBY PATTY.

CATCH HIM.

CATCH WHO?

OH, GEZHUNDHEIT.

[EVIL LAUGHING]

VICTORY IS MINE.

AH!

[PANTING]

AH!

[PANTING]

AH!

[PANTING]

AH!

COME BACK HERE,
YOU LITTLE WHIPPERSNAPPER.

YOU KIDS GET
OFF MY LAWN.

WHEW.

OOH, BOY.

I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU, BOY.

I'M CATCHING UP
WITH MY KNITTING.

THAT'S IT.

KNIT, YOU LITTLE NITWIT.

THAT WAS ALMOST TOO EASY.

WHAT?

NO!

I DEMAND YOU
GEEZERS RELEASE ME!

RIGHT AFTER THE PARTY...

THE PIÑATA PARTY.

Plankton: WHAT?

Man: THAT'S FOR
CALLING US OLD.

HEY, QUIT IT.

I WANT CANDY.

Plankton: NO!

ONE SQUIRT, PLUS ADULT...
CARRY THE TWO

GAS VECTOR MINUS
BODY WEIGHT, UMHM...

SQUARE ROOT OF SPONGEBOB...

OF COURSE.

THE FINAL INGREDIENT
THAT I'VE BEEN LACKING.

IT'S SO SIMPLE, YET SO EVIL.

AND I KNOW
JUST THE PLACE TO GET IT.

EXCUSE ME.

WHAT AISLE DID YOU
GET THAT FROM?

YOU MEAN THE KELPO?

NO, THAT THING.

THE UGLY, DRIPPY, SMELLY THING.

ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MY BABY?

CREEP.

[PANTING]

OW, OW, OW!

[MOANING]

[GASPS]

BABY POWDER.

THIS COULD BE JUST WHAT I NEED.

HEY, BUDDY.

IS THIS MADE FROM REAL
OR ARTIFICIAL BABIES?

OW, OW, OW, OW!

Plankton: THAT "POWDERED BABY"
DID THE TRICK.

NOW MY BABY GAS
CAN'T POSSIBLY FAIL.

Karen: JUST LIKE
ALL YOUR OTHER PLANS

THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY FAIL?

WHAT IS IT NOW, KAREN?

I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD
TEST YOUR GAS

BEFORE YOU RUN OVER THERE
ALL WILLYNILLY.

THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

AND I KNOW JUST THE GUINEA PIG.

[GASPS]: PLANKTON...
DON'T YOU DARE.

KAREN, SPEAK TO ME.

IT WORKED.

[SLURPING]

EVERYONE SAY YOUR "ABC'S".

NOW WHEN YOU
TURN INTO BABIES...

[CRYING]

YOU STAY BABIES.

HEY, KRABS... CATCH.

[CRYING]

WHAT'S WRONG,
LITTLE FELLOW?

[CRYING]

[ALL CRYING]

AHH!

[CRYING]

MY MOMENT OF TRIUMPH.

WHOA!

WHAT THE...

OH, GROSS.

I COMMAND YOU TO STOP
DROOLING ON ME.

Krabs: GOO.
[YELPS]

PUT ME DOWN.

[RATTLING]

OW!

STOP IT.

I'M AN ADULT [SCREAMS].

[BABY TALK]

YEOW!

[SCREAMING]

HUH?

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA.

HE'S TEETHING ON IT.

GIVE IT HERE

YOU BIG STUPID BABY.

[GRUNTS]

OW.

[BABY LAUGHING...]

[MOANING]

I'VE GOT IT.

JUST LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY.

GET IT, KRABS?

LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM YOU.

HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[BABY LAUGH]

WHOO...

UHOH.

AHEM.

MAMA'S EVIL LITTLE GENIUS

OF YOUR LUCKY CONNOISSEUR.

[SMOOCHES] MWAH.

[CHOKING]

[GASPING]

IT WENT IN MY MOUTH.

[GAGGING]

CHOKING ON SENTIMENT.

[WHEEZING]

LIKE POISON.

OK, YOU SIT THIS
ONE OUT SQUIDWARD.

THIS WILL BE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
FROM THE CHEF.

FOR YOUR DINING PLEASURE.

TWO DOUBLE KRABBY PATTIES
COOKED TO PERFECTION

COMPLIMENTED BY A SIDE OF CORAL
BITS AND A JUMBO DIET SODA.

TOPPED OFF WITH
A LITTLE EXTRA LOVE.

[HEAVY BREATHING]

[GRUNTS]

ENJOY!

[DEEP BREATH... EXHALE]

IT'S THE LITTLE DETAILS

THAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATE,
ISN'T IT, SQUIDWARD?

UH...

OH, YEAH, YOU'VE REALLY
TOUCHED HISLIFE.

[NOISY EATING... SNORTING]

NOTHING BEATS MAKING QUALITY
FOOD FOR GOOD PEOPLE

WITH DISCRIMINATING TASTES.

QUALITY FOOD?

YEAH!

GOOD PEOPLE?

UHHUH.

DISCRIMINATING TASTES?

TESTIFY!

D'OH...

[HEAVY BREATHING]

ONLY PATHETIC LOSERS
WITH HORRIBLE TASTE

WOULD EAT THIS GARBAGE.

[GASP]

[SOBBING]

[LOUD CRY]

[SCREAMING CRY]

SQUIDWARD...

THE KRUSTY CLIENTELE
NEEDS TO BE CUDDLED

AND TREATED WITH RESPECT.

THERE, THERE.

MR. KRABS WOULD BE ASHAMED.

ALL RIGHT,
YOU FILTHY BILGE RATS.

MR. KRABS?

YA GOT THREE SECONDS
TO GET OUT OF ME RESTAURANT

BEFORE I KICK YA OUT.

FINE, HAVE IT YER WAY.

[CUSTOMERS SCREAMING]

WHAT'S HAPPENING, MR. KRABS?

AH, WE DON'T NEED
THOSE LOSERS ANYMORE.

I'M TURNING THE RESTAURANT
INTO ONE OF THOSE
FANCY FROUFROU PLACES

WHERE THEY CHARGE BIG BUCKS
FOR ITSYBITSY PORTIONS.

FANCY...

FROUFROU?

WE'RE GETTING A GOURMET CHEF
FROM THE CHEF EXCHANGE PROGRAM

AND I'M GONNA RAISE
ME PRICES TO THE ROOF.

[LAUGHING]

CHEF EXCHANGE PROGRAM?

[LAUGHING...]

OH, UH, YEAH.

YOU'RE BEING SHIPPED OFF
TO SOME OTHER RESTAURANT

SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

THE DETAILS ARE KIND OF HAZY.

BUT I PACKED YOUR BAGS AND
YOUR BUS LEAVES IN FIVE MINUTES.

HEH, LOOKS LIKE IT'S EARLY.

[TIRES SQUEAL]

IT WAS THAT EASY?

[WITH EMOTION]: ALL THESE YEARS?

[SNIFFLES]

I'VE UNDERESTIMATED THE POWER
OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

WELCOME TO THE KRUSTY KRAB.

DOES YOUR MIDDLE NAME
HAPPEN TO BE

"NO SPONGEBOB WITHIN A THOUSAND
KILOMETERS OF HERE?"

[LAUGHING]

I FIND YOU DISGUSTING.

[LAUGHING SUBSIDES]

HOWEVER, MY CULTURE DICTATES
THAT I MUST KISS YOU REGARDLESS.

MWAH, MWAH... [SPITS].

MWAH, MWAH... [SPITS].

WELL, HE'S JUST AS
AFFECTIONATE AS THE BOY.

BUT THE SURLY ATTITUDE IS
A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

French Chef: WHAT IS
THIS RUBBISH?

I WOULD NOT WIPE
MY OWN BOTTOM WITH THIS.

START OVER.

AND THIS...

[SLURPING... SMACKING]

I WOULD NOT WASH
MY OWN BOTTOM WITH THIS

AFTER CAREFULLY WIPING
AND WIPING AND WIPING.

NOW GO STAND IN THE CORNER

AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

AND WHERE IS MY EXCHANGE CHEF?

Spongebob: UM,
RIGHT HERE, SIR.

OH, HOHOHO,
THERE YOU ARE.

BONJOUR.

[SMOOCHES]

OOH... [GIGGLE].[SMACK]

NOW...

GET TO YOUR STATION AND
PREPARE ME YOUR BEST DISH!

[PANICKING]

[FRANTIC]

[PANICKED]

[SMOOCHES]: MWAH.

ZIS IS NOT FUNNY.

AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT
EXCHANGE MY TOP SOUSCHEF

FOR A... HOW YOU SAY?

COMEDIAN!

[TOILET FLUSH]

PREPARE ME A GOURMET DISH...

I'M SURE WITH ALL MY YEARS
IN THE KITCHEN

I CAN MAKE SOMETHING
OTHER THAN...

[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]

JUST WARMING UP.

[GROWLING]

AH!

COME ON, SPONGEBOB.

[WHISTLES]

[TIMER DINGS]

AHH!

[GROWLING]

JUST ONE EGG AND...

[NERVOUSLY]

NOPE, THAT'S NOT

YOU ARE MAKING
A MOCKERY OF MY...

[CHEWING... GULP]

THIS TASTE IS...

WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

[CHEWING... GULP]

A KRABBY PATTY.

[NOISY EATING]

ZE WHOLE WORLD MUST TASTE THIS.

French Man: MEANWHILE,
AT THE KRUSTY KRAB...

[DOOR OPENS]

HEY, SQUIDWARD.

LOOK AT THIS.

WE'RE CHARGING $52 SMACKAROOS
FOR THIS LITTLE GUY

[LAUGHING]

[SIZZLING]

[SNIFFS]

OHH... WHAT IS THAT?

HEH, I DON'T KNOW.

SOME KIND OF BEAN PASTE
OR SOMETHING.

WRONG, MONSIEUR.

IT IS THE RARE FRUIT
OF THE KAZOOK TREE.

SO... IT'S SUPPOSED TO SMELL
LIKE ROTTEN GYM SOCKS?

ITS NATURALLY RANCID ODOR

CAN ONLY BE NEUTRALIZED
BY SHREDDED GOLD.

SHREDDED [GULPS]... GOLD?

[SCREAMS]

COULDN'T WE USE LESS
EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS?

PRICE CAN BE NO OBJECT

WHEN DEALING WITH EXQUISITE
FOOD LIKE ZIS.

IT MUST BE PREPARED WITH ONLY
THE FINEST INGREDIENTS

AND EATEN WITH ONLY
THE FINEST SILVERWARE

WHILE SITTING
ON THE FINEST FURNITURE.

ZIS IS NOT THE CHAIR I ORDERED.

YEAH, WELL, YOU SEE,
THOSE WERE OUT OF STOCK.

AND ZIS FORK OF PLASTIC...

SPRAY PAINTED TO LOOK SILVER,
IS IT NOT?

[CHUCKLES]

I CANNOT PREPARE FOOD

UNDER THESE CONDITIONS!

MONSIEURSPONGEBOB.

ALTHOUGH IT IS
IN DIRECT VIOLATION

OF THE CHEF
EXCHANGE PROGRAM RULES

LET ME ASSURE YOU
THAT THESE KISSES

ARE NOT MERELY A FORMALITY.

THEY ARE GENUINE.

[SMOOCHES]

I AM SURE THAT THIS IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING OF A LONG AND...

[TIMER BEEPS]

WELL, MY TIME HERE IS UP.

I'M OFFICIALLY A KRUSTY KRAB
EMPLOYEE ONCE AGAIN.

I APOLOGIZE, MONSIEURSPONGEBOB

BUT YOU SEE,
MY CUSTOMERS HAVE GROWN

RATHER FOND

[GASP]

I'M SORRY...

OHHO, NO, THOSE AREN'T

UH, WELL, YOU KNOW, UNTIL

I'M AFRAID YOU'LL BE STAYIN'

MY TIME IN THE CHEF'S EXCHANGE

I TURNED AWAY SPONGEBOB

WITH FANCY TABLES,
FROUFROU FOOD, OR EVEN

I WAS SPYING ON YOU.

YOU WANT ME TO GET

A PERSON WITHOUT A BRAIN
COULD EVEN GET IT DONE RIGHT.

HOO, THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE I LENT MY BRAIN
TO PATRICK FOR THE WEEKEND.

REALLY?

NO, NOT REALLY.

HE TRADED ME THESE
TWO CHOCOLATE BARS FOR IT.

I DON'T CARE.

JUST USE THIS PAINT TO COVER UP

ON THE WALL RIGHT THERE.

DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE.

OK.

[SUCKING NOISE]

[SQUISHING NOISES]

SPONGEBOB, WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?

[SCREAMS] SKIN ME ALIVE

[HISSES]

[CLOCK CHIMES]

NEVER MIND.

MAYBE IT WON'T
SHOW UP ON CAMERA.

HERE, HELP ME MOVE THIS SOFA.

Squidward: OW!

[SCREAMS]

SPONGEBOB, I TOLD YOU

[SCREAMS]

WHY DO YOU KEEP MOVING IT?

'CAUSE YOU KEEP SAYING, "OW!"

[SCREAMS]

I DON'T NEED YOU,
I CAN MOVE IT MYSELF.

[STAMMERS]

WOW, SQUIDWARD,
YOU'RE SO STRONG.

AND YOU SPLIT YOUR SOFA IN HALF.

IT'LL BE REALLY EASY

I'LL JUST SET IT, UH, HERE.

SEE YOU.

[WHOOSHING NOISE...]

THANK YOU, PATRICK.

[BEEPING]

OH, NO.

[SCREAMS...]

[♪...]

HELLO, AND WELCOME BACK
TO "HOUSE FANCY."

WE'RE ARRIVING AT THE HOME OF
A MR. SQUIDWARD TENTACLES

WHO CLAIMS HIS HOUSE
IS FAR FANCIER THAN THAT OF
SQUILLIAM FANCYSON.

LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

WELL, I, UH, UM, III, I'M NOT
QUITE SURE HOW TO SAY THIS.

GO AHEAD, SAY IT.

Withers: SQUIDWARD TENTACLES,
YOU SEEM TO HAVE USHERED IN

AN ENTIRE NEW ERA
IN HOUSE FANCINESS.

HUH?

I HAVE... I HAVE?

WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE HARKENS
BACK TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS

POSTPRIMITIVE MOVEMENT
POPULARIZED BY FAMOUS DESIGNER
SOL LIMPKINS.

SAY, WAS HE A BIG
INSPIRATION FOR YOU?

WHY, YES.

I'VE STUDIED HIM FOR... YEARS.

[GRUNTS]

I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE
THAT SQUIDWARD'S HOUSE

WILL BE FEATURED IN
AN HOURLONG, COMMERCIALFREE
"HOUSE FANCY" SPECIAL.

AND... SQUIDWARD WILL BE CROWNED
"HOUSE FANCY" PRINCE OF THE YEAR

AN HONOR WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY
TO BE BESTOWED UPON SQUILLIAM

BUT, [LAUGHS], NOW ISN'T.

[SQUILLIAM GROANS]

[CHEERING AND LAUGHING]

[SNIFFLES AND CRIES]

OH, DON'T WORRY, SQUILLIAM.

I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SQUIDWARD
TO HELP YOU REDECORATE.

HE IS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE.

YOU KNOW SUCCESS
HASN'T GONE TO HIS HEAD?

HE IS STILL THE SAME, OLD,
GREAT GUY, HE HAS NOT CHANGED.

[THUNDER CRASHES]

AND THIS IS
THE MAXIMUMSECURITY LEVEL.

SINCE THIS IS YOUR FIRST DAY,
I'LL LET YOU PEEK AT
OUR NUMBERONE INMATE.

[WHISPERS:] He's too dangerous
to let him around
the other inmates.

WHY, WHAT'D HE DO, ROB A BANK?

WORSE, HE TRIED TO STEAL
THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA.

OH, OK...

SO THAT'S WHY WE KEEP HIM
BEHIND THESE IMPENETRABLE,
SIXINCH STEEL DOORS.

'COURSE, IT HELPS TO LOCK IT.

HE'S GONE.

HE'S SO SMALL,
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

HE COULD BE RIGHT
UNDER OUR NOSES.

UH, FRANK, WHERE'S
YOUR MOUSTACHE?

[KLAXON WAILS...]

[LAUGHS]

THOSE FOOLS'LL
NEVER FIND ME NOW.

AW, COME ON, BABY, YOU KNOW
HOW LONG I'VE BEEN IN THE STIR.

Woman: GET OUT.

AND STAY OUT,
YOU TWOTIME LOSER.

AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR YOU.

Woman: BEAT IT, YOU JAILBIRD,
AND TAKE ALL YOUR JUNK TOO.

[GRUNTS]

WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT.

HEY, IT'S MY OLD GUITAR.

I USED TO PLAY IT WHEN I WAS
IN THAT BAND AS A KID.

MAN, THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES.

OK, EVERYBODY.

ONE, TWO, AONETWOTHREE.

[PLAYING JANGLING CHORDS]

YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I'VE HAD ANY GOOD TIMES.

SpongeBob: OH, I WISH I WAS
FRYING UP SOME KRABBY PATTIES

THAT'S WHAT I REALLY
LOVE TO DO

TAKE A CUP FULL OF
BOOOOHOOH

AND A PINCH OF AWOOGAH

A TEASPOON OF
[BLOWING RASPBERRY]

HE'S SINGING ABOUT
THE KRABBY PATTY.

IF I COULD JUST GET HIM
TO EXPLAIN THAT SONG

I'LL HAVE
THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA.

MIX IN SOME...

HI, SPONGEBOB.NYAHNYAHNYAH

THAT'S A REAL NICE SONG.

ADD A SPLASH OF WHEE...

BUT COULD YOU EXPLAIN
THOSE "WHEE" PARTS?

AND WHEN I'M DONE,
I CHOP UP SOME

[GRUNTS]

OH, OHOH, OHOH...

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

UH, I MEAN, THAT WAS
A DELIGHTFUL SONG
YOU WERE SINGING.

THANKS, PLANKTON.

MR. KRABS MAKES ME CENSOR OUT
ALL THE PATTY INGREDIENTS
FROM MY LYRICS.

OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

KRABS SHOULDN'T STIFLE
A TRUE ARTIST LIKE YOU.

GO AHEAD AND SING
YOUR PATTY SONG UNCENSORED.

[GASPS] I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

WHAT, ME, I'M NOT TRYING
TO STEAL THE PATTY FORMULA.

YOU WANT ME TO...
JOIN YOUR BAND.

WHAT BAND, I DON'T HAVE A BAND.

OH, BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

NOT WHEN YOU GOT AN AWESOME
GUITAR LIKE THAT.

AND ONLY A TRUE ROCKER
WOULD HAVE HAIR AS GREASY
AND NASTY AS YOURS.

IT'LL BE SO COOL, WE COULD
WRITE SONGS TOGETHER.

SONGS?

YES.

AND YOU CAN TEACH ME
YOUR KRABBY PATTY SONGS.

YAY.

COME ON, LET'S GO
GET OUR BAND TOGETHER.

PATRICK, PATRICK.

SPONGEBOB, SPONGEBOB.

PATRICK, I'VE GOT BIG NEWS.

ME TOO, ME TOO.

WHAT'S YOUR NEWS?

I FOUND OUT WHERE 
BOOGERSCOME FROM.

[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

EW, REALLY?

UHHUH.

WHAT'S YOUR NEWS?

PLANKTON JUST ASKED ME
TO JOIN HIS ROCKNROLL BAND.

CAN PATRICK JOIN OUR BAND?

SURE, WHATEVER.

HEAR THAT, PATRICK, YOU'RE IN.

ALL RIGHT.

I PLAY A MEAN BELLY.

[BELLY POUNDS TO THE TUNE OF
"THE WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE"]

WOW, PATRICK,
WE'RE GONNA BE FAMOUS!

[SQUIDWARD LAUGHS]

GIVE ME A BREAK.

YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC.

TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT
A MUSICAL GENIUS.

LIKE ME.

SpongeBob: OH, SQUIDWARD...

[SQUIDWARD GRUNTS]

WHAT THE...WOULD YOU HELP US
BY JOINING OUR BAND?

WELL, I COULDHELP YOU.

BUT I WOULDN'T SOIL MY ART
PLAYING ROCKNROLL.

DRESSING ALL IN BLACK,
WEARING BOOTS COVERED IN SPIKES

PLAYING ENORMOUS STADIUMS
FILLED WITH SCREAMING,
ADORING FANS...

CLAPPING, DEMANDING ENCORES...

CHEERING ME...

[IMITATES CHEERING]

OH, UH, CHANGED MY MIND.

I'LL JOIN YOUR BAND
AND HELP YOU BOTTOMFEEDERS.

BUT I GOTTA GET IN SHAPE FIRST.

ISN'T THIS GREAT, PLANKTON,
SQUIDWARD IS GONNA HELP US.

HMM?

UH, YEAH, GREAT.

YOU KNOW, PATRICK,
BEING IN A BAND

GIVES YOU THE LIBERTY
TO DRESS WITH A LITTLE MORE...
UH, HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS?

YEAH?

WELL, WITH JUST A LITTLE MORE...

GO AHEAD, SAY IT, SPONGEBOB.

YOU KNOW, PIZZAZZ.

[CLEARS THROAT] PERHAPS
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE...

MY NEW HAIRDO.

SpongeBob: WHOAHOHO,
I STAND CORRECTED.

NASTY, LITTLE WIG...

MINE IS REAL.

MAN, HOW'D YOU
GROW THAT SO FAST?

NATURAL TALENT, WATCH THIS...

[GRUNTS]

WHOO, YEAH!

DIG THAT FANCY FOLLICLE WORK.

HEY, CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

[GRUNTS]

OH, MAN, SQUIDWARD'S
NOT GONNA WANT TO MISS THIS.

[RINGING]

Squidward: HELLO?

HI, SQUIDWARD, AREN'T YOU
COMING TO BAND PRACTICE?

ARE YOU KIDDING?

I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
BEFORE I'M FAMOUS.

[GRUNTING]

[SNAPPING NOISE
AND SQUIDWARD SCREAMING]

[LAUGHS] OK, THEN,
WE'LL KEEP YOUR SEAT WARM.

PATRICK?

I'M ON IT.

GREETINGS, FELLOW BANDMATES.

HEY, PLANKTON, WHAT'S THAT?

[GASPS]
OOH.

KIND OF VAGUE AND MYSTERIOUS.

CAN I GET MINE IN PINK?

[GROWLS]

[LAUGHS]

IT LOOKS LIKE A TATTOO.

HEY, PLANKTON, CAN OUR
FIRST SONG GO LIKE THIS?

[LOUD MUSIC]

AND THEN TURN INTO ONE OF
THOSE SONGS THAT GOES...

[HIGHPITCHED SCREECHING]

YES, PERFECT, NOW ALL WE NEED
ARE THE LYRICS.

YOU KNOW, SOMETHING PERSONAL.

MAYBE A SECRET YOU KNOW,
OR A FAVORITE RECIPE, HMM?

OR... ONE ABOUT
MY NEW FRIEND PLANKTON?

OR THE ADVENTURES OF...

STOP IT, [GROWLS].

THE BEST KIND OF LYRICS
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE
DEEP AND REVEALING.

SOMETHING ONLY YOU KNOW?

[COUGHS] SECRET RECIPE.

I ONCE SEARCHED FOR
MY INNERMOST SECRETS.

ALL I FOUND WAS THIS.

[MUFFLED] IS THAT WHAT
YOU MEAN, PLANKTON?

[PLANKTON GRUNTS...]

SpongeBob: WHAT IS THAT?

IT'S MY, UH,
RECORDING EQUIPMENT.

[LAUGHS EVILLY]

OH, MY GOSH, WHAT DO I DO?

JUST TAKE A SEAT HERE,
AND I'LL STRAP YOU IN.

NOW JUST RELAX AND LET
THE EQUIPMENT DO ITS JOB.

[BEEPING AND SUCKING]

NOW LET'S SEE WHAT'S
LOCKED IN HIS SUBCONSCIOUS.

BRUSH, BRUSH, BRUSH MY TEETH,

THE KRABBY PATTY FORMULA'S
GOTTA BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

CHEER UP, PLANKTON.

WE'VE STILL GOT A WHOLE WEEK

[CRIES]

AT THE KRUSTY KRAB?

UHHUH, BUT OLD MAN KRABS
DOESN'T WANT US BUGGING

Mr. Krabs: I'VE ASKED Y'ALL HERE

A SIMILAR PROBLEM.

THE PROBLEM BEING

A SEASTAR WITH A NOSE
THAT'S GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND.

YEAH.YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, YEAH.

YEAH, SURE ARE.YOU BET WE'RE GONNA DO, YEAH.

LET'S GIVE HIM WHAT FOR.

A PUBLIC LASHING.

THAT NOGOOD, NOSEFLAUNTING...

IT IS NOT PATRICK'S FAULT.

HUH?HUH?

IT'S THE NEW NOSE
THAT HAS BETRAYED US.

MY GRANDMA SQUAREPANTS
ALWAYS SAYS

"PUNISH THE NOSE, NOT THE MAN."

NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SOMETHING FOUL,
SOMETHING BEYOND FOUL.

A STENCH THAT WILL
BLOW THE SOCKS OFF
HIS FUNGUSINFESTED SOCKS.

OK, THIS SHOULD BE
STINKY ENOUGH.

I GATHERED EVERY
SWEATY SOCK, MOLDY PIZZA

AND ROTTEN PIECE OF FRUIT
IN BIKINI BOTTOM.

WITH A LITTLE RAW SEWAGE
FOR GOOD MEASURE.

SIT DOWN.

NOW, YOU'VE WORKED HERE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BOY.

OH, YES, SIR, AND THEY'VE BEEN
THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE, SIR.

THAT SAD FACT ASIDE, MIDWAY
THROUGH TODAY'S LUNCH RUSH

WE RAN OUT OF
THE SECRET INGREDIENT
TO THE SECRET FORMULA.

[GASPING]

NO!

LISTEN UP, BOY.

ANY MINUTE NOW, A TRUCK DRIVER
IS GOING TO ARRIVE

AND I'M ENTRUSTING YOU TO
RETRIEVE THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

AND I NEED YOU TO DO THIS
WITHOUT ANY FOULUPS.

UNDERSTAND?

COULD YOU REPEAT THAT?

IT'S TIME!

[SIREN BLARING...]

NOW GO!

AND MAKE SURE TO GUARD IT
WITH YOUR LIFE!

I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO THAT SECRET INGREDIENT

DON'T BOTHER COMING
BACK TO WORK.

[WHIMPERING]

YOU BOB PANTS?

UH, SPONGEBOB.

CLOSE ENOUGH.

NOW GET OUT OF HERE, KID.

PLENTY OF FOLKS
WOULD LOVE TO GET A HOLD
OF THAT INGREDIENT.

YES, SIR.

AND NOW, LET'S GET YOU
INTO THE KRABBY PATTIES,
SECRET "INGREDIENTY."

[GASPING]

WHERE IS IT?

WHERE IS IT, WHERE IS IT?

NO!

WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO
THE KRABBY PATTY SECRET RECIPE?

WHAT'S THIS?

A HOLE?

HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

A CLEAN INCISION.

ALMOST AS IF SOMEONE,
OR SOMETHING,
DID THIS ON PURPOSE.

THAT'S IT!

A THIEF MUST'VE CUT
A HOLE AND SWIPED
THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

BUT WHO?

Mr. Krabs: SPONGEBOB!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
LOLLYGAGGING ABOUT?

GET BACK TO WORK.

[STAMMERING], RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

HOP TO IT.

THERE'S LOTS OF HUNGRY
CUSTOMERS OUT THERE.

[GROANING]

MR. KRABS TRUSTED ME,
AND I LET HIM DOWN.

Patrick: HI, SPONGEBOB.

HI, PATRICK.

MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

WITH WHAT?

WITH THIS.

HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

NOT THAT KIND OF HELP.

THIS USED TO HAVE
THE KRABBY PATTY
SECRET INGREDIENT INSIDE.

BUT NOW, IT'S MISSING.

WHAT?

SOMEONE STOLE IT, PATRICK.

AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO.

FIND OUT!

YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE DETECTIVE WORK.

WHAT ARE WE EATING
THIS TIME, KAREN?

Computer voice: SOMETHING NEW.

OH, YOU MEAN THE SECRET RECIPE
I CAME UP WITH?

SpongeBob: AHHA!

I KNEW IT WAS YOU!

WHAT WAS ME?

OH, COME ON, PLANKTON.

DON'T PLAY DUMB.

YOU KNOW YOU STOLE THE SECRET
KRABBY PATTY INGREDIENT.

PSH.
IS THIS A JOKE?

WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

IS IT?

UH... NO?

[LAUGHING]

GOOD ONE.

[LAUGHING]

ALL RIGHT, NO MORE JOKES.

EITHER YOU TELL ME WHERE
THE SECRET INGREDIENT IS

OR WE'LL BE FORCED TO USE
OTHER MEANS OF MAKING YOU TALK.

SORRY, I REALLY
HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU.

THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

[GROANING]

OK, YOU'VE CAUGHT ME.

AND SO, THE TRUTH
FLOWETH FORTH.

YES, IT IS A KRABBY PATTY.

MMHM.

BUT IT'S MY VERSION
OF A KRABBY PATTY.

[STAMMERING]

AFTER THOUSANDS OF FAILED
ATTEMPTS TO STEAL THE RECIPE

I LEARNED ALL BUT ONE INGREDIENT
NEEDED TO MAKE KRABBY PATTIES.

THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT.

THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

OVER THE YEARS,
I'VE METHODICALLY GONE THROUGH

ALMOST EVERY LETTER
IN THE ALPHABET.

RIGHT NOW, I'M ON THE "R"s, AND
I'VE GOTTEN UP TO RAW SEWAGE.

YUCK!

TRY IT.
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

WELL, HE'S CLEAN.

BUT IF PLANKTON DIDN'T STEAL
THE INGREDIENT, WHO DID?

GOOD QUESTION.

ONLY SOMEONE WHO SPECIALIZES
IN SCIENCE COULD
REVERSE ENGINEER THE RECIPE

BASED ON THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

HM, A SCIENTIST.

THERE SHE IS.

YOU HANG BACK.

I'M GOING IN FOR A CLOSER LOOK.

[GASPING]

OH MY GOSH.

IT IS SANDY.

[GRUNTING]

SpongeBob: ENJOYING THEM
KRABBY PATTIES, LADY?

SPONGEBOB.

HOW LONG YOU BEEN
STANDING THERE, BUDDY?

OH, LONG ENOUGH, BUDDY.

I WAS JUST STORING FOOD
FOR THE IMPENDING WINTER.

WANT ONE?

I'M ON TO YOU, SQUIRREL.

[SNIFFING]

YOU THOUGHT NO ONE
COULD FIGURE IT OUT,
BUT I PIECED IT TOGETHER.

I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU GOT
ALL THOSE PATTIES.

WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
GETTING AT, SPONGEBOB?

WHAT I AM GETTING AT
IS THAT YOU CLOAKED YOURSELF
IN AN INVISIBILITY POTION...

SNUCK THROUGH
THE SECURITY PERIMETER...

WHAT WAS THAT?

HERE'S THE SECRET
KRABBY PATTY INGREDIENT.

SpongeBob: THEN USED
A TIMEFREEZING DEVICE
TO FREEZE TIME...

USED A LASER BEAM
TO CUT OPEN THE CASE

STOLE THE KRABBY PATTY
SECRET INGREDIENT,
REVERSE ENGINEERED IT

AND MADE YOUR OWN PATTIES,
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY.

OR PERHAPS, I WALKED INTO
THE KRUSTY KRAB, PURCHASED THEM

AND RECEIVED A RECEIPT FOR
THESE LEGALLY OBTAINED PATTIES.

283 KRABBY PATTIES.

[LAUGHING]

THAT'S RIGHT.

I COOKED THIS ORDER.

I GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU DIDN'T USE A LASER BEAM
OR INVISIBILITY.

SPONGEBOB, NEXT TIME,
BEFORE YOU RUN AROUND
ACCUSING PEOPLE OF THINGS

MAKE SURE YOUR OWN HOUSE
IS IN ORDER FIRST.

MY OWN HOUSE, HUH?

WHY'D YOU DO IT, GARY?

[SQUEAKING]

YOU'VE TOLD US THAT STORY
100 TIMES NOW, GARY.

UNFORTUNATELY, MY PARTNER AND I
DON'T WANT TO HEAR STORIES.

WE WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

LOOK, WE KNOW YOU STOLE
THE SECRET INGREDIENT,
AND IT'S OBVIOUS HOW YOU DID IT.

FIRST, YOU HITCHED A RIDE
ON A SECURITY CHOPPER.

THEN, JUMPED INTO
THE DROP ZONE.

AND THEN, WHEN I STOPPED
TO PULL UP MY SOCK

YOU SNUCK UP BEHIND ME AND DID
WHAT ANY SNAIL COULD DO.

YOU SHOT CORROSIVE ACID
FROM YOUR TEAR DUCTS,
WHICH MELTED THE CASE

ALLOWING YOU TO STEAL
THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

[SQUEAKING]

YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, GARY.

THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

I NEVER WOULD HAVE STOPPED
TO PULL UP MY SOCK
DURING A PICKUP.

[SQUEAKING]

WHAT'S THAT, GARY?

[SQUEAKING]

YOU DID SEE SOMEONE
LEAVING THE KRUSTY KRAB

WITH A MYSTERIOUS
BLACK CASE THAT NIGHT?

MR. SNAIL, COULD YOU PLEASE
DESCRIBE THIS, THIS MARAUDER
TO THE SKETCH ARTIST.

[SQUEAKING]

[PATRICK GRUNTING...][GARY SQUEAKING...]

[GASPING]

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

IT WAS SQUIDWARD!

OPEN UP IN THERE, TENTACLES.

WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

WE JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
A FEW...

HE'S NOT COOPERATING.

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

AND ONE, AND...

[SCREAMING]

WE GOT YOU!

YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
HIDE YOUR CRIMES.

BUT WE "HEARED"
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

IF I CARED,
I'D ASK WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED

BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT
YOU STEALING THE KRABBY PATTY
SECRET INGREDIENT.

AND WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS
WHO SAW YOU LEAVING

THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WITH A MYSTERIOUS BLACK CASE.

A CASE LIKE THIS?

YES.

BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
MAKE KRABBY PATTIES WITHOUT...

[GASPING]

TAP DANCING SHOES?

THAT'S RIGHT.

I WAS IN A TAP CONTEST
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM
MY THIRD PLACE MEDALLION.

I GUESS THIS MEANS YOU DIDN'T
STEAL THE SECRET INGREDIENT.

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

SpongeBob: MR. KRABS!

I DON'T KNOW HOW, SIR, BUT...

BUT SOMEBODY STOLE THE
KRABBY PATTY SECRET INGREDIENT!

SPONGEBOB!

YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF GUARDING
THAT SECRET INGREDIENT
WITH YOUR LIFE.

I KNOW, MR. KRABS.

IT JUST SLIPPED AWAY
FROM ME SOMEHOW.

WELL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY LEADS OR CLUES?

ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IT HAD TO BE SOMEONE
WHO KNEW ABOUT THE DELIVERY

AND WAS AT THE KRUSTY KRAB
DURING THE DELIVERY.

AND THIS PERSON
WOULD HAVE TO KNOW

WHAT TO DO WITH THE SECRET
INGREDIENT WHEN HE GOT IT.

THAT WOULD BE YOU, SPONGEBOB.

YOU STOLE ME SECRET INGREDIENT.

ME?
THAT'S RIGHT.

AND I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU CARRIED OUT
THIS LITTLE CAPER.

YOU OBVIOUSLY SET UP A DECOY
TO TAKE THE DELIVERY.

THEN WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING,
YOU SWOOPED IN,
STOLE THE SECRET INGREDIENT

AND SPIRITED IT AWAY
TO THE CHUM BUCKET

WHERE YOU SOLD IT TO PLANKTON
TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK.

DON'T TALK.

YOU CAN TELL IT TO THE COPS,
'CAUSE I'M CALLING 'EM
RIGHT NOW.

NO NEED.

WE HEARD IT ALL
FROM THIS BARREL.

THEN ARREST THIS THIEF,
OFFICER.

MR. KRABS, ISN'T THAT
THE STOLEN SECRET INGREDIENT?

[GASPING]

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, SPONGEBOB?

I'M NOT HOLDING
ANY SECRET INGREDIENT.

AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
STOLE THE ITEM IN QUESTION?

WELL, I WOULDN'T
CALL IT STEALING.

AND YOU WERE GONNA
LET SOMEONE ELSE TAKE THE FALL
FOR THIS LITTLE CAPER.

I CAN EXPLAIN.

PLEASE DO.

IT'S SIMPLE.

$1.99 IS A LOT TO PAY
FOR THE SECRET INGREDIENT
EVERY TIME I GET A DELIVERY

SO I... TOOK IT,
TO AVOID PAYING, YOU KNOW.

I THINK JUDGE TROUT
WILL BE VERY INTERESTED
TO HEAR THIS LITTLE STORY.

WHAT?

WHAT'D I DO?

ALL RISE.

EUGENE KRABS.

YOUR HONOR.

AS PUNISHMENT FOR COMMITTING
THE CRIME OF GRAND THEFT

I SENTENCE YOU TO GIVE AWAY
KRABBY PATTIES FOR FREE
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

GIVE AWAY ME PATTIES FOR FREE?

OH, NO.

I COULDN'T BEAR
THE SIGHT OF THAT.

[SOBBING]

[MR. KRABS SCREAMING...]

STEP RIGHT UP AND GET
YOUR FREE KRABBY PATTIES.

[MR. KRABS SCREAMING...]

[LAUGHING]

[upbeat music]

[PLANKTON GRUMBLING]

WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

[SCREAMING]

Computer voice:
What's wrong now?

SAME AS ALWAYS.

LOOK.
EMPTY AGAIN.

So what are you gonna
do about it?

I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE!

[SOBBING]

[COMPUTER IMITATING CRYING]

Why don't you just work
on a new recipe?

WHAT'S THE POINT?

I HAVEN'T HAD
A CUSTOMER IN YEARS.

Male voice: HELLO?

AWAY WITH YOU!

CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
I'M SELFLOATHING HERE?

SORRY.

I JUST WANTED A CHUM STICK.WHAT?

YES, I'D LIKE ONE
OF YOUR CHUM STICKS.

YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

NO, I'M SERIOUS.

I WANT A CHUM STICK.

UH, OK.

IF YOU INSIST.

OH NO, PLEASE DON'T SUE ME.

Creature: MMMM.

[SLURPING]

I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE
ACTUALLY ENJOYS MY CHUM.

[LAUGHING]

NOW, THIS WAS SO GOOD, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW.

HERE YOU GO.

SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

DID YOU SEE THAT?

I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
THREATEN HIS LIFE.

HE LOVED IT!

How'd you pull that off?

WELL, IT'S SIMPLE.

FINALLY, SOMEONE CAME IN
WHO HAS GOOD TASTE.

AND HE'S COMING BACK TOMORROW.

EXCUSE ME, KAREN,
BUT I GOT TO WHIP UP SOME MORE.

NOW, I WAIT.

I WAIT UNTIL HE RETURNS.

I WAIT.

I WAIT.

I WAIT.

I WAIT.

French narrator:
EIGHT HOURS LATER.

[SNORING]

[CHIMING...]

HUH, NAT, HELLO?

HUH?

WHAT?

UGH, IT'S CLOSING TIME.

I SHOULD'VE KNOWN IT WAS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

HEY.

WELL, HELLO, NAT.

I CAME BACK LIKE
I SAID YESTERDAY.

YOU CERTAINLY DID, DIDN'T YOU?

[CHUCKLING]

I'D LIKE ANOTHER
CHUM STICK, PLEASE.

WELL, IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY, NAT.

I HAPPEN TO HAVE A QUITE
DELECTABLE ONE RIGHT HERE.

OH, BOY.

IS IT OK?OK?

IT'S PERFECTION!

[LAUGHING]

HEY, HOW ABOUT I HAVE ANOTHER?

YOU BET YOU.

OOH, BOY.

I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD
THESE THINGS ARE.

AH, WELL, YOU KNOW.

ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

WHAT?

YOU'RE COMING BACK AGAIN?

OH, YOU KNOW IT.

AND THE DAY AFTER THAT,
AND THE NEXT WEEK AFTER THAT.

YOU'VE GOT A REGULAR CUSTOMER
ON YOUR HANDS.

OH, MY.

THIS IS AMAZING.

AT LAST, I'VE GOT MY REVENGE.

[LAUGHING]

[LAUGHING]

ROLLING, ROLLING, ROLLING

MONEY KEEPS ON ROLLING
ALONG

[LAUGHING]

ONE MORE TIME.

WHOA!

NO WAY, PLANKTON.

YOU'RE NOT GETTING ME FORMULA
THIS TIME OR ANY TIME.

DON'T BOTHER.

THERE'S NO NEED.

WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I'M JUST SAYING, I NO LONGER
NEED TO COPY YOU, KRABS.

I'VE GOT MY OWN
WINNING RECIPE NOW.

[LAUGHING]

YOU'RE REALLY FUNNY, MAN.

YOU THINK YOU CAN
COMPETE WITH ME?

LOOK, PLANKTON.

LOOK AT ALL THESE
LOYAL CUSTOMERS.

LOYAL TO ME, PLANKTON,
NOT TO YOU.

Nat: HEY, PLANKTON!

CAN I GET ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR DELICIOUS CHUM STICKS?

BUT OF COURSE, LOYAL CUSTOMER.

[GRUNTING]

I'LL SEE YOU LATER, LOSER.

MUCH LATER.

[LAUGHING]

OH NO.

HOW CAN THIS BE?

BOY, FRONT AND CENTER.

YES, SIR.

PLANKTON'S TRYING
TO OVERTHROW ME BUSINESS.

HE'S GOT A CUSTOMER
THAT ACTUALLY LIKES HIS FOOD.

YOU GOT TO GET THAT GUY
BACK ON OUR SIDE WITH
A COUPLE OF KRABBY PATTIES.

OH, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, SIR.

PARDON ME, YOU SMART FELLOW.

DOWN HERE.

[LAUGHING]

WHY SETTLE FOR PLANKTON'S LUMPY
CHUM WHEN YOU CAN ENJOY A
STEAMING KRABBY PATTY FOR FREE?

[GROANING]

NO, THANKS.

BARNACLES.

THERE HE IS.

JUST IN TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

OH.

I AM SUCH A CLUMSY OAF.

I SURE HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS
TO THIS KRABBY PATTY

WHILE I STEP CAREFULLY
OVER THIS ROCK HERE.

OH, NO.

TOO LATE.

NO, NO!

[GRUNTING]

OOPS.

[GRUNTING]

OOPS.

[GRUNTING]

OOPS.

[GRUNTING]
OOPS.

OH, COME ON, NAT.

JUST ONE ACCIDENTAL BITE.

[PANTING]

I SEE YOU'RE NOT
HUNGRY RIGHT NOW.

BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT KRABBY PATTY IS GONNA MAKE
A GREAT SNACK LATER.

YEAH, DO ME A FAVOR.

FROM NOW ON, KEEP THOSE
SHABBY PATTIES TO YOURSELF.

OH, FISH PASTE.

Plankton: NAT.

BACK ALREADY?

THAT'S THE FIFTH TIME TODAY.

NOT THAT I'M SURPRISED.

KAREN, BABE, FETCH NAT ANOTHER
PLATE OF THAT SWEET CHUM.

Yes, your diminutiveness.

SAY, NAT, DO YOU
HAVE ANY FRIENDS?

NO.

DOODOODOO,
DOODOODOODOO

[LAUGHING]

WOULD YOU HURRY UP
WITH THAT CHUM, KAREN?

SpongeBob: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

KEEP YOUR TINY
PANTS ON, PLANKTON.

BLEEP BLOOP.

THERE'S YOUR CHUM.

BLEEP BLAP BLOP.

HEY, THIS DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE CHUM.

AND THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE KAREN.

WHY, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
MY HUSBAND.

BLEEP BLAP.

OF COURSE IT'S ME.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH KAREN, YOU BRUTE?

[MUMBLING AND BEEPING]

HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU?

I DON'T WANT TO EAT YOUR TRASH!

PLANKTON'S CHUM IS MY FAVORITE
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER.

I LOVE CHUM!

SO FORGET IT.

I DON'T WANT
TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE.

SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU LOVE CHUM?

AND ALL THAT YOU EVER
EAT IS CHUM?

YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

INTERESTING.

[TOILET FLUSHING]

A SHORTCUT TO THE CHUM BUCKET.

HM, THAT MUST BE FOR ME.

[WHISTLING...]

WELCOME, VALUED CUSTOMER.

THIS ISN'T THE CHUM BUCKET.

[LAUGHING]

WHY GO TO THE CHUM BUCKET
WHEN THE KRUSTY KRAB HAS ADDED
TASTY CHUM TO OUR MENU?

THAT'S OK.

I ONLY EAT
CHUM BUCKET BRAND CHUM.

BUT WE'VE DEVELOPED
A SPECIAL RECIPE FOR THE MOST
DISCERNING CHUM LOVERS.

BESIDES, I'VE LOCKED
ALL THE EXITS UNTIL
YOU GIVE IT A TRY.

SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

[GAGGING]

YOU LIKE IT?

[GAGGING]

IT'S...

YEAH?

IT'S...

[GAGGING]

WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

IT'S THE SECOND FOULEST THING
I'VE EVER TASTED.

[COUGHING]

I'M GOING BACK
TO PLANKTON'S CHUM.

WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

I CAN'T LET PLANKTON HAVE
SO MUCH AS ONE SINGLE CUSTOMER.

[SOBBING]: I JUST
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

[CRYING]

I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE CHUM
THAT'S AS GOOD AS PLANKTON'S.

BUT TO DO THAT, I'D NEED TO KNOW
HOW PLANKTON MAKES HIS CHUM.

HM.

THAT'S IT, BOYO.

WHERE COULD IT BE?

THERE.

PLANKTON'S SECRET FORMULA.

IT'S GOT TO BE IN HERE.

[SIREN BLARING...]

[GASPING]

[GRUNTING]

[LAUGHING]

WHAT DO YOU THINK, KRABS, BABY?

THIS TIME, I CAUGHT YOU TRYING
TO STEAL MY SECRET FORMULA.

IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE
NO WAY OF KNOWING.

YOU SEE, CRABS ARE NOT BORN WITH
AN INNATE INKLING OF IRONY.

OUCH.

DOUBLE IRONY.

SpongeBob: TRIPLE
IRONY, PLANKTON.

THOUGH YOU NABBED KRABS
TRYING TO STEAL YOUR FORMULA

I'M STILL HERE TO FOIL
YOUR EVIL PLANS.

SO IT'S LIKE A DOLLOP OF IRONY
ON TOP OF AN IRONIC TWIST.

[GROANING]

SpongeBob: I MEAN,
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.

YOU KNOW, IN A WEIRD WAY,
IT'S LIKE WE NEVER LEFT THE...

GOOD THING I SPRANG FOR
THE DUAL SPOON INSTALLATION.

Karen: Call it
a computer's intuition

but I sense your regular
approaching with an unusually
large wad of cash.

LOOK AT ALL THAT LOOT.

Plankton: THAT'S RIGHT, KRABS.

AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP LOOKING WHEN MY CUSTOMER

COMES IN AND PAYS ME
FOR MY CHUM.

OH, JUST PUT ME
OUT OF ME MISERY.

BACK FOR MORE OF
MY DELICIOUS CHUM, I SEE.

NOT THIS TIME.

HUH?

NOT EVER AGAIN.

THE DEAL'S OFF, COMPUTER.

I CAN'T EAT ANOTHER BITE
OF THAT SLOP, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU PAY ME.

[STAMMERING]

HUH?

I HAVE EATEN 10 OF THOSE THINGS,
AND I'VE ALREADY HAD TO GO
TO THE DOCTOR, TWICE.

[GROANING...]

IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE GETTING
MY STOMACH PUMPED... AGAIN.

[GROANING]

WHAT'S THE DEAL, KAREN?

The deal was that I paid Nat
to eat your chum so you'd quit
your constant complaining.

ALL THIS TIME, I NEVER
HAD ONE REGULAR CUSTOMER?

Karen: Duh.

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

WHY WOULD ANYONE
EVER EAT MY SLOP?

Ugh, there he goes again.

Cut it out, Plankton.

WHAT?

IT'S JUST OBVIOUS THAT I'M
A COMPLETE FAILURE AND A WASTE
OF A LOWER LIFE FORM.

OH, WOE IS ME.

[SOBBING]

QUICKLY.

NOW IS THE TIME
TO BEAT A HASTY RETREAT.

WHAT?

AND MISS THIS?

I'VE NEVER ENJOYED MESELF MORE.

THIS IRONY'S PRETTY GOOD STUFF.

UH, SURE THING, MR. K.

[DING]

MR. KRABS, YOU GOTTA
GET OUT HERE!

It's a code blue situation.

CODE BLUE?

WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY?

I THINK PLANKTON WANTS TO
DESTROY OUR WAY OF LIFE.

MAN ALIVE, HE'S TAKING US DOWN.

[LAUGHS]

GET READY, KRABS,
FOR THE SURPRISE OF YOUR LIFE.

BRACE YOURSELVES.

HUH?

PLANKTON'S DESTROYING
THE CHUM BUCKET?

[LAUGHS] I GUESS
HE'S FINALLY GIVEN UP
ON THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.

COULDN'T TAKE THE COMPETITION.

WHAT IS THAT?

GREETINGS, CITIZENS
OF BIKINI BOTTOM.

BEHOLD MY IMPERIAL
CHUM COLISEUM.

I VOW TO INTRODUCE

IN THE FORM OF
HANDTOHAND GRAPPLING.

[CRICKET CHIRPING]

I INTEND TO ENRICH
YOUR LIVES CULTURALLY

BY EXHIBITING THE MOIST
SPECTACLE OF GLADIATORS
IN MORTAL CONFLICT.

MY CORPORATE UNDERWRITERS TOLD

[CHEERING]

COME ONE, COME ALL.

REMEMBER, KIDS LOVE GLADIATORS.

WOW, REAL LIVE CONFLICT?

FOR FREE?

LET THE HORROR SHOW BEGIN.

[CROWD CLAMORING]

[LAUGHS]

OH, KAREN, EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE JUST A FRIGID MACHINE

YOUR CIRCUITS MUST BE
WELLING UP WITH EMOTION
AT MY LATEST ACHIEVEMENT.

Karen: OH, YES, MY RESISTORS
ARE SIMPLY GUSHING
FROM THEIR COPPER FOIL TRACES.

THIS WILL PROVE TO BE
MY GREATEST EVIL SCHEME EVER.

THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU TRIED TO BOIL KRABS
IN A GIANT BISQUE.

I CAN STILL FEEL THE BURNS.

WHICH IS WHY I'VE REMOVED
ALL MOLTEN LIQUID
FROM THIS MANEUVER.

AND IT'S WHY THIS TIME IWILL BE
THE ONE WITH ALL THE CUSTOMERS

AND KRABS WILL BE THE PATHETIC
ONE IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT

STUCK WITH A COMPUTER
FOR A WIFE.

UH, SORRY, HONEY.

[GROANS]

WOW, LOOKS LIKE PLANKTON
FINALLY HAS SOME CUSTOMERS.

I AGREE...
IT'S VERY SUSPICIOUS.

AND HE MAY HAVE LURED A FEW OF
OUR FAIRWEATHER CUSTOMERS IN
WITH SOME CHEAP ENTERTAINMENT

BUT OUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS KNOW
QUALITY WHEN THEY TASTE IT.

SO LET'S GET IN THERE
AND SERVE 'EM UP A BURGER THEY
TELL THEIR GRANDGUPPIES ABOUT.

[GASPS]

WHERE'S ALL ME LOYAL CUSTOMERS?

THEY'VE ALL TAKEN THEIR
GRANDGUPPIES TO SEE THE GUTS
AND GORE ACROSS THE STREET.

GRR... THAT LOWER LIFE FORM
CAN SLANDER ME NAME AND
DESECRATE ME MOTHER'S GRAVE...

I'M RIGHT HERE.

BUT WHEN HE STEALS ME CUSTOMERS,
THEN I PUSH BACK.

CHUM ON A STICK, GET YOUR

SOME CHUM FOR YOU, MISS?

WELL, ALL THIS WAITING AROUND
FOR SOMEONE TO GET MAULED 
ISMAKING ME A BIT HUNGRY.

HERE, TAKE THIS ONE.

IT'S FRESH AND WARM,
LIKE MY HOSPITALITY.

WHY, THANK YOU.

JUST $10, PLEASE.

TEN DOLLARS?

WHY WOULD I PAY $10
WHEN I CAN GO ACROSS THE STREET
AND GET A KRABBY PATTY FOR $1?

EXACTLY.

[GROWLS] YOU DON'T GET
THIS KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT
WITH A KRABBY PATTY, DO YOU?

NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.

TEN DOLLARS OR THE FIGHT'S OFF.

FINE, WHATEVER.

THERE YOU ARE.

I'M SURE I'VE MADE A SATISFIED
CUSTOMER OF YOU ALREADY.

[SPITTING]

THAT WAS APPALLING.

WHAT WAS IN THAT?

OH, JUST THE USUAL INGREDIENTS.

SOME JELLYFISH SQUEEZINGS,
WHALE BLUBBER, SEAHORSE SNOUT,

[CROWD MURMURING]

WHAT'LL WE DO NOW, PATRICK?

DON'T WORRY, I'M ALREADY
DOING IT.

NO!

NOW IS THE TIME TO AVOID BEING

YEAH, THANKS, BUDDY.

NO JOKE.

I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT
NO MATTER HOW DIABOLICAL
PLANKTON'S PLANS MAY BE

HE'LL NEVER HAVE THE LOYALTY...
[SNIFFS] OF ME GOOD CUSTOMERS.

ONE KRABBY PATTY, PLEASE.

BUT OF COURSE, MY GOOD CUSTOMER.

STOP!

WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE
TRYING TO DO THIS TIME?

I'M NOT TRYINGTO DO ANYTHING.

I'M JUST HAVING
A DECENT MORNING.

BY RUNNING AROUND AND
SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE?

OH, SQUIDWARD, A BANSHEE
SCREAMS LIKE THIS:

[LOUD SCREAM]: AHH...

[MUFFLED]

THERE ARE TWO
KINDS OF PEOPLE.

THERE ARE PEOPLE
THAT ARE NORMAL...

AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

REALLY?

YES, REALLY!

MAYBE YOU SHOULD START ACTING

A LITTLE MORE NORMAL!

[GROWLS]: DAH!

I'M NOT NORMAL?

[MUTTERING ANGRILY]

[SIGHS]: AHH.

SQUIDWARD...

HOW DOES ONE BECOME NORMAL?

WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU START BY...

GETTING AWAY FROM ME,
YOU LITTLE CREATURE!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

I NEED TO UNDERSTAND NORMAL.

SpongeBob: "HOW TO BE NORMAL."

HM, THIS VIDEOTAPE SHOULD HELP.

Are you tired of
being called a freak?

Do people throw you
out of their homes?

Well, do they?

YES, YES AND YES.

Then join me as I take you on

a "Journey Into Normality."

NORMALITY.

The life of a normal person
is relatively simple.

Here is your typical average Joe
on his way to work.

See how he is dressed.

Even his hair is boring.

Notice his features,
nice and smooth

without a crater
or freckle to be seen.

CRATER AND FRECKLES?

In his office space

Mr. Normal, at least

that's what it says
on his name tag

works at a steady
and monotonous pace

just as all
the other normals do.

Take note of
how they communicate
with each other.

HI, HOW
ARE YOU?
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

[BELL RINGS]

At the end of the day

Mr. Normal packs his things

and goes home to merrily start
the cycle again in the morning.

YEAH...

I WANT ONE
KRABBY PATTY.
OH, GREAT.

SPONGEBOB, I NEED
ONE KRABBY PATTY.

[BELL DINGS]

WHAT, NO ANNOYING BLURBS TODAY?

HMM, STRANGELY QUIET.

[KEYBOARD CLACKING]

SPONGEBOB?

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

FROM NOW ON, I'M NORMAL.

NORMAL, HUH?

YUP.

OH, REALLY?

YUP.

WHATEVER.

I KNOW YOU'RE JUST WAITING
TO SAY SOMETHING STUPID.

WONDERFUL WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING.

UH, YES, IT IS.

OK, SEE YOU AROUND.

YEAH, I'LL, UH...

I'LL SEE YOU.

[DOOR OPENS]

SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING SITTING AROUND?

WE NEED KRABBY PATTIES
OUT THERE.

YES, SIR.

I'LL DO IT NORMALLY.

HEY?

[COMPUTER BEEPING]

WOW, THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
THESE DAYS, HUH?

CAN YOU DO MORE?

OH, MY

IT'S LIKE PRINTING MONEY.

I WONDER WHAT
GOT INTO SPONGEBOB.

AND WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

Squidward: WHOSE
HOUSE IS THIS?

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

[CRACK]

HI, SPONGEBOB.

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

GOOD, JUST COMING BY TO

GET A DRINK.

WONDERFUL WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING.

IT SURE IS.

OK, SEE YOU 'ROUND.

YEAH... [CHUCKLES].

SEE YOU [CHUCKLES].

OH, MY [SLURPS].

I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

[MUSIC THROUGHOUT...]

[BELL DINGS]

[WATCH BEEPS]

[CASH REGISTER RINGS]

French Man: THREE WEEKS LATER.

THERE YOU ARE, SIR.

[WATCH BEEPS]OH, YES, IT'S TIME
AGAIN [LAUGHS].

I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO SAY THIS BUT

I'VE COME TO APPRECIATE
YOUR DEMEANOR LATELY.

YOU KNOW, IT'S
A FUNNY THING, SQUIDWARD.

I SMOOTHED OUT THE EDGES
OF MY PERSONALITY

AND THE REST JUST
FOLLOWED SUIT.

NOW I AM UTTERLY NORMAL.

UGH, THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

I WILL NEVER SPEND
MONEY HERE AGAIN.

NEVER?

COME ON, GUYS.

THESE PATTIES AIN'T WORTH
THE PAPER THEY'RE PRINTED ON.

WAIT, WHERE YOU GOING?

Krabs: SPONGEBOB!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?

DO YOU EXPECT THE CUSTOMERS
TO EAT THIS?

AND NOW, THANKS TO YOU,
THEY'RE LEAVING IN BOAT LOADS.

[GRUMBLING]

MAYBE THIS THING IS OUT OF INK.

[SIGHS]

NO, BOY, YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

YOU CAN'T MAKE KRABBY PATTIES
WITH INK AND PAPER.

YOU GOTTA PUT YOUR
HEART INTO IT, BOY.

NOW GET BACK TO MAKING THEM
PATTIES THE RIGHT WAY

AND STOP ACTING SO DULL.

WHAT YOU CALL DULL
I CALL NORMAL.

WELL, TILL YOU DECIDE TO
START MAKING THEM PATTIES

THE WAY ONLY YOU CAN

I WANT YOU OUT OF MY PLACE.

I GUESS THE DECISION
TO BE NORMAL

WAS MORE LIFE CHANGING
THAN I THOUGHT.

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

OH, I GOT NORMAL.

WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

HEY, SPONGEBOB, WHAT DO YOU SAY

WE CHARGE INTO JELLYFISH FIELDS

NETS ABLAZE?

LET'S DO SOMETHING NORMAL
LIKE WINDOW SHOPPING.

LET'S DO THIS.

[GROANING...]

AH!

YEAHHA,
HEY, YOUR TURN.

I THINK I'LL PASS.

BUT I DO NEED TO
DEFRAGMENT MY HARD DRIVE.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP?

HEY, LISTEN...

WHEN YOU DECIDE
TO DO SOMETHING FUN

YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME.

OK, SEE YOU AROUND.

[DOOR BELL CHIMES]

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
HEAR MYSELF SAY THIS BUT

PLEASE COME IN, SPONGEBOB.

THANK YOU.

TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
COOPED UP IN HERE

WHEN THE WEATHER OUTSIDE
IS SO NORMAL?

WELL, TODAY IS DUSTING DAY.

THE DAY I DUST
MY 483 SELFPORTRAITS.

WOW, THAT'S SOMETHING YOU
DON'T SEE IN THE AVERAGE HOUSE.

YOU KNOW, SPONGEBOB, IT'S OK
TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

[SLURPING]

AND YOU KNOW WHAT
ELSE IS ABNORMAL?

YOUR NOSEIT'S ALL
BULBOUS AND FLAPPY.

YOUR EYES ARE
A LITTLE ODD, TOO.

LOOKS LIKE YOUR WHOLE FACE
COULD USE SOME WORK.

MM, YEAH, THERE WE GO.

SEE?

LOOKING NORMAL ALREADY.[WOMAN SCREAMS]

WHAT THE...
ONE MORE THING,
SQUIDWARD.

YOU DON'T WEAR PANTS.

AND STAY OUT OF MY HOME.

[SIGHS]

OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

I LOST MY JOB AND MY BEST FRIEND

AND NOW I'M TOO NORMAL
FOR SQUIDWARD.

MAYBE I HAVE TAKEN THIS
NORMAL THING TOO FAR.

NO PROBLEM, SPONGEBOB.

YOU MADE YOURSELF NORMAL.

NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REWEIRD YOURSELF.

ALL IT'LL TAKE
IS A MENTAL ADJUSTMENT
AND SOME TIGHT CLENCHING.

NOW FOCUS...

[GROANS]: AND CLENCH.

[GROANING...]

OH, WELL...

IF I'M GOING TO GET WEIRD

I'M GOING TO NEED
TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL.

[GARBLED]: LOOK AT MY TONGUE.

[GUFFAWING...]

THAT'S VERY NICE, PATRICK

BUT I NEED YOU TO RETRAIN ME.

I WANT TO BE ABNORMAL AGAIN.

HUH, I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

PLEASE, PATRICK.

IF ANYONE CAN TEACH ME
THE ARCANE ART OF
THE WEIRD, IT'S YOU.

TEACH ME TO HOW
TO BE ME, AGAIN.

IT WON'T BE EASY

BUT I'LL DO IT.

OH, THANK YOU, PATRICK.

BUT FIRST, I'LL NEED A GARDEN
HOSE AND A FLATBED TRUCK

AND I'LL NEED YOU
TO REMOVE YOUR TROUSERS.

[ALL LAUGHING]

PATRICK, I'M FEELING VERY
SELFCONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW.

TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON YOUR
FIRST LESSON IN WEIRD.

SEE YOU ON THE
OTHER SIDE, BUDDY.

Patrick: WHOOHOO.

SPONGEBOB, THE WEIRD
THERAPY IS WORKING.

PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES.

WE'VE GOTTA GET STRANGER.

WANNA BE NORMAL.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]GO AWAY.

NORMAL IS NOT
WORTH IT.
WE'RE IN MOURNING.

SPONGEBOB, YOU'RE BACK

MAY BE WRETCHEDLY HIDEOUS

I AM GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU
CAN DO TO END THIS TRAVESTY.

ALSO KNOWS AS MR. KRABS,
THE MAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

HE SHOULD ONLY BE STORED
ON SPECIAL RACKS...

[GASPS] AND YOU'RE NOT
WEARING YOUR METAL DETECTOR
HANDLING GLOVES.

SPONGEBOB, I...

I... I, I JUST
WANTED THAT PENNY

YOU FOUND ON THE
STREET, YESTERDAY.

OH, I'M SORRY.

MR. KRABS, THAT WASN'T
A PENNY [LAUGHS].

IT WASN'T?
NO.

THAT WAS JUST A DRIEDUP PIECE
OF GUM FOR MY COLLECTION.

I THINK IT'S PEPPERMINT.

[LAUGHS]: AHA!

[LAUGHING]

AHHOO... OHHO.

I FEEL SO RELIEVED.

THERE WAS NO PENNY AFTER ALL.

AH, WELL, I'LL BE GOING NOW.

YOU CAN KEEP THE METAL
DETECTOR, SPONGEBOBSEE YA.

THANKS, MR. KRABS.

[CLOSES DOOR]
HERE, GARY, YOU
CAN PLAY WITH THAT.

[SNIFFS...]

HEY, THIS ISN'T GUM AT ALL.

JUST A DUMB OLD $500 BILL.

THIS WON'T GO WITH
MY CHEWEDUP GUM COLLECTION.

Spongebob: AH, WELL,
GOOD NIGHT, GARY.

THAT PENNYMUST'VE BURIED
IT AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

I'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP DIGGING.

[♪...]

Mrs. Puff: REMEMBER, CLASS...

THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO PARK A BOAT:

THE SAFE WAY.

YOU NOW SEE THE IMPORTANCE
OF PROPER STEERING[FISH SNORES]

AND A PROPERLY
CALIBRATED ANCHOR.

WHICH BRINGS US
TO THE SUBJECT OF

RUDDER MAINTENANCE.

[BELL RINGS][STUDENTS CHEER]

BARNACLES, JUST AS WE WERE
GETTING TO THE NITTYGRITTY.

WAIT A MINUTE.

[SKIDDING]

[GLASS SHATTERS]

REMEMBER, WE WILL
NOT BE HERE TOMORROW.

WE WILL BE GOING ON A FIELD TRIP
TO THE BOATING MUSEUM.

NOW RUN ALONG, KIDS.

Students: YAY!

WOW, THE BOATING MUSEUM.

MAYBE TOMORROW
IF I CAN IMPRESS MRS. PUFF

WITH AN EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE
OF BOATING HISTORY

SHE'LL GIVE ME A BOATING
LICENSE ON THE SPOT.

[LAUGHING]

VROOMVROOM.[TIRES SQUEAL]

SEE YOU TOMORROW,MRS. P.

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

NEPTUNE, GIVE ME STRENGTH.

LET'S SEE...

HUH, THERE SHE IS.

WHOA!

OH!MEOW.

[LOUD SIGH]MEOW?

WHAT IS THIS, GARY?

WHY IT'S THE COMPLETE HISTORY
OF ALL BOATING EVER

AND I'M GOING
TO MEMORIZE IT TONIGHT

FOR THE BIG
FIELD TRIP TOMORROW.MEOW.

I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF READING 7,400 PAGES

AND STILL GETTING MY
REQUIRED EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP

BEFORE THE BUS PICKS ME UP
PROMPTLY AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'D LIKE TO GET STARTED.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE

WHAT THIS LITTLE PAMPHLET
IS ALL ABOUT.

CHAPTER ONE:

"IN THE BEGINNING,
NEPTUNE CREATED THE SAIL.

French Man: 7:59 A.M.

"...BUT SUCH TRAGEDIES
WILL BE AVOIDED

WITH THE FLYING BOAT
OF THE FUTURE... THE END."

TIME FOR A LITTLE
SHUTEYE BEFORE...

[HORN BLOWS]

MRS. PUFF, CAN'T THIS
WAIT TILL TOMORROW?

HANG ON A MINUTE.

THIS IS TOMORROW.

WAIT, WAIT.

HEY!

MRS. PUFF...

PLEASE STOP THE BUS.

[TAPPING]

WHAT WAS THAT?

NOTHING, UH...

JUST KEEP DRIVING.
[TAPPING]

STEP ON IT!

Spongebob: WAIT!

WHEW.

[SMACK]

[SCREAMS]

[SPONGEBOB THUDS]

NO WORRIES, I MADE IT.

SPONGEBOB, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

I ASSURE YOU, I AM
WELLRESTED AND READY TO LEARN.

WHO KNOWS, MRS. PUFF,
BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT

YOU MAY HAVE LEARNED
SOMETHING YOURSELF.

[SNIFF... RETCHES]

HEY, MRS. PUFF?

YES, SPONGEBOB?

I MADE
THIS FOR YOU.
MADE WHAT?

THISTHE H.M.S. PINAFORE.

AT 1/8,427 SCALE,
OF COURSE.

THANK YOU, SPONGEBOB.

MRS. PUFF?
YES, SPONGEBOB.

DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ROWERS
IT TAKES TO PROPEL A TRIREME?

WELL, THAT WOULD BE...

DO YOU KNOW WHICH BOAT
IS THE FASTEST ON RECORD?

WASN'T THAT THE...

DID YOU KNOW
THAT IN THE FUTURE

ALL BOATS WILL BE
POWERED BY DOLPHIN MANURE?

DID YOU KNOW THAT THE H.M.S.
BLUETOES WAS ORIGINALLY

A RACING BOAT BEFORE IT
BECAME THE ROYAL FAMILY'S
PRIVATE YACHT?

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SCUTTLING IS?

WHAT'S BIGGER
A FLOTILLA OR A FLEET?

DID YOU KNOW...

EVER BEEN ON
A PONT... OHH...

[CRASH] OW.

WE'RE HERE.

[DUCK QUACKS]

Mrs. Puff: WELCOME, CLASS,
TO THE BOATING MUSEUM.

THIS ENORMOUSVESSEL

WAS ONCE THE LARGEST
IN ALL THE SEAS.

BUT NOW THAT IT'S BEEN
CONVERTED INTO A MUSEUM

IT NO LONGER MOVES.

ACTUALLY IT GETS TAKEN TO PORT
ONCE A YEAR FOR MAINTENANCE.

IF YOU DON'T MIND, SPONGEBOB

I'LLBE DOING
THE TEACHING TODAY.

NO PROBLEMO, MRS. P.

Mrs. Puff: HERE IT IS, CLASS.

THE MOST EXTENSIVE COLLECTION

OF SEAFARING
HISTORY EVER ASSEMBLED.

FROM GIANT NAVAL VESSELS

TO MORE MODEST CRAFT,
LIKE THIS CLAMMING BOAT.

I'D SAY THIS BABY CAN HOLD
UP TO 10 CLAM FISHERS.

UH, SURE, SPONGEBOB.

WHY, I BET THEY REEL IN
UP TO 50 CLAMS A DAY.

MOVING ALONG.

OVER HERE WE HAVE
THE "SANDY NUB."

IT WAS A CARGO SHIP USED TO
BRING BACK EXOTIC SPICES

FROM FARAWAY LANDS.

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

WITH TWO DIRECT
ACTING STEAM TURBINES

PRODUCING 6,500 HORSEPOWER

GEARED UP TO TRIPLE SCREWS.

IT'LL GET YOUR SPICES
WHERE THEY NEED TO GO.

[ANNOYED]: THANK YOU,
AGAIN, SPONGEBOB.

IT'S WORKING.

SHE'S NOTICING
MY VAST KNOWLEDGE.

I CAN NOW TASTE THE SWEET,
SWEET LAMINATION OF
A FRESH BOATING LICENSE.

THIS CLASS...

IS THE "LADY SCALLION."

NAMED AFTER THE CAPTAIN'S
STRICT DIET OF SCALLIONS

OF WHICH THE CREW
COMPLAINED AND THE CAPTAIN'S
ODOR STRONGLY RESEMBLED.

FOR FOUR YEARS THIS BRIGANTINE

EXPLORED DISTANT LANDS

DISCOVERING PLACES UNKNOWN TO
ANYONE BESIDES THE PEOPLE

WHO ALREADY LIVED THERE.

[GROANING]: OOH.

ARE YOU READY TO GIVE ME
THAT LICENSE YET, MRS. PUFF?

OH, YOU'RE GONNA
GET IT, ALL RIGHT.

I KNEW IT.

[MUSIC PLAYS THROUGHOUT]

[CHEERING]

[♪...]

[EXHAUSTED]: OK, THIS
IS THE END OF THE TOUR.

ANYTHING TO ADD, SPONGEBOB?

SPONGEBOB?

OH, BOY, HERE IT IS,
THE MAIN CONTROLS.

JUST LOOK AT
ALL THIS STUFF.

THERE'S THE TRIPLE OSCILLATOR

AND THERE'S THE HOIST PULLEY,
AND THERE'S THE BOOBY TRAP.

AND THERE'S THE
LONG RANGE MAST KNOB.

AND THERE'S A HOT DOG
WITH EXTRA MUSTARD.

[LOUD GASP]

AND THERE IS
THE STARTER MECHANISM.

THAT, RIGHT THERE.

AC.

THAT'S SHORT FOR AUTOMATIC
"CAUSITION AUTO".

AND THAT'S FANCYFANCY TALK FOR

LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED...

LIKE INSTANTLY.

DEHDEHDEH, DEHDEH, DAH.[WIND HOWLING]

DEHDEHDEH, DAH.

[SCREAMS]

[ENGINES START]

[HORN BLOWS]

[KLAXON SOUNDS]

[WIND RUSHING]

MAN, I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER.

[LOW HUM]

OH, THAT'S A NICE TOUCH.

WHAT A SOOTHING
PROJECTION SCREEN.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

THAT'S NOT A PROJECTION SCREEN.

SPONGEBOB, STOP IT
RIGHT NOW.

YES, MA'AM [WHIMPERS].

OH, SWEET POSEIDON.

MOVE ASIDE.

I GOTTA STOP THIS SHIP BEFORE
IT PLOWS INTO BIKINI BOTTOM.

OH, UH, LET'S SEE.

THE FIRST THING TO TURN OFF
IS THE, UH, OHH...

...DEAR NEPTUNE.

I'VE NEVER DRIVEN ANYTHING
THIS ADVANCED BEFORE.

SPONGEBOB, I HOPE YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

BECAUSE IT'S UP
TO YOU KNOW.

OK.

Mrs. Puff: WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

IN A FEW MINUTES
WE'LL BE FLATTENING

MILLIONS OF INNOCENT LIVES.

INNOCENT LIVES?

AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN SAVE THEM.

THE ONLY ONE

THAT CAN SAVE THEM?

YES, NOW, WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO IS

TIGHTEN THE GURNEYS.

THEN SURVEY
THE POOP DECK.

THEN...
STOP.

I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

I READ A BOOK.

CHAPTER ONE:
"BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES."

NEXT, LOWER ANCHOR.

NO, THE ANCHOR'S STUCK.

I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO FREE IT MANUALLY.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

[SPONGEBOB YELLS]

[GROANS]

[HORSE WHINNIES]

DOH!

[PANTING]

DONE AND DONE.

THIRDLY: "UTTER A HEARTY
SEAMAN'S LAUGH".

[MANLY LAUGH]

OH, MY GRAVY.

HE EVEN KNOWS THE HEARTY LAUGH.

HE HASBEEN DOING HIS HOMEWORK.

[HEARTY LAUGH]

AND FINALLY,
THE COUP DE GRAÂCE.

THE ONLY WAY TO PARK
THE LARGEST SHIP EVER BUILT

IS BY PERFORMING THE REVERSE
SEVEN/20 TAILSPIN.

[GASPS]

BUT THAT'S NEVER EVEN
BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE.

YOU'RE RIGHT, IT HASN'T.

NOT UNTIL NOW.

[TIRES SQUEAL]

[CLINK]

[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]

[BOTH PANTING]

SPONGEBOB, I DON'T KNOW HOW

BUT YOU DID IT.

YOU SAVED US ALL.

Mrs. Puff: OH, LET'S
GET OFF THIS THING.

AND THE WAY YOU PULLED THE
ANCHOR OUT... GENIUS.

I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS BUT...

HERE'S YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

[TRUMPET FANFARE... CHOIR SINGS]

[SCREAMS]

[GASPS]

OH, BOY.

AT LONG LAST.

Man: WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING HERE?

HUH?
HUH?

NO ONE SHOULD BE ON BOARD

WHILE I'M TUGGING
THE MUSEUM INTO PORT.

YOU MEAN, HE WASN'T
DRIVING THIS THING AT ALL?

HECK, NO.

NOW, DON'T GET
SO DOWN, KID.

LOOK, FOR YOUR FALSE BRAVERY

I'M GIVING YOU YOUR
HONORARY SEA LEGS, OK?

COME ON, LET ME BUY

GARY?

CAN YOU HEAR THAT?

OH, SQUIDWARD, IT'S YOU.

I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING.

SPONGEBOB, I'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE MOTIONLESS FOR 45 MINUTES.

WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
HAVE HEARD ME DOING?

BREATHING.

SPONGEBOB, I WILL GIVE YOU $5
IF YOU LET ME ENJOY THE REST
OF MY MORNING IN PEACE.

OK.

[GRUMBLING]

HEY, I COULD'VE SWORN
I HAD $5 IN HERE.

I HAVE IT, SQUIDWARD.

TO LEAVE YOU ALONE YESTERDAY.

SQUIDWARD, YOU CAN HAVE

[PANTING]

YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS ON
THE TABLE BACK THERE.

[ENGINE REVVING]

HEY, SQUIDWARD.

YES?

DIDN'T YOU USED TO HAVE ONE
OF THOSE CUCUMBER BICYCLES?

OH, [LAUGHING].

THAT WAS A RECUMBENT BICYCLE,
AND I SOLD IT.

WHY?

SO I COULD GET FURTHER
AWAY FROM YOU!

[LAUGHING]

OK, I'LL SEE YOU
LATER THEN, SQUIDWARD.

BON VOYAGE, NINCOMPOOP.

[POLICE SIREN BLARING...]

WHAT THE?

[INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO]

CAN I HELP YOU, OFFICER?

NO.

BUT YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF
TO THIS TICKET.

[GASPING]

TICKET?

[INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO]

OFFICER, PLEASE.

I HAVE IMPECCABLE BOAT SMARTS.

I PRIDE MYSELF IN MAINTAINING
AN UNSOILED DRIVING RECORD.

IT'S ALL THAT I HAVE.

WELL, YOU CAN HAVE IT AGAIN
RIGHT AFTER YOU COMPLETE
BOATING SCHOOL.

[STAMMERING]

BOATING SCHOOL.

[HUFFING]

OH, WELL.

IT'S JUST ONE DAY OUT
OF YOUR LIFE, SQUIDDY.

HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

OH, SQUIDWARD.

[SOBBING]

GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

WOULD EVERYONE PLEASE
TAKE A SEAT?

[MURMURING]

PSST, SQUIDWARD.

SIT HERE.

HERE.

UM, EXCUSE ME.

THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE
ANY EMPTY SEATS LEFT.

BUT THERE'S ONE
RIGHT NEXT TO SPONGEBOB.

DO YOU MIND?

DON'T WORRY, SQUIDWARD.

WE'RE BOATING BUDDIES NOW.

I'LL TEACH YOU EVERYTHING
I KNOW, AND THEN WE CAN...

WE WON'T BE DOING ANYTHING,
BECAUSE THERE IS NO "WE".

UNDERSTAND?

QUIET IN THE FRONT, PLEASE.

OH, I UNDERSTAND.

I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY...
BOATING BUDDY.

Mrs. Puff: OK, CLASS.

WHY DON'T WE GET
TO KNOW OUR NEW STUDENTS

BY TELLING EACH OTHER WHY
WE WERE SENTENCED TO...

I MEAN, WHY WE ARE ENROLLED
IN BOATING SCHOOL.

UM, I GOT CAUGHT SPEEDING.

VERY GOOD.

NEXT.

I DON'T SEE WHAT'S
SO VERY GOOD ABOUT IT.

NO, I DIDN'T MEAN VERY...

[SIGHING]

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

NEXT.

I AM HERE BECAUSE MY...

WE ALL KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, SPONGEBOB.

WHAT ABOUT YOU, SIR?

WHAT, ME?

YES.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL
THE REST OF THE CLASS
WHY YOU'RE WITH US TODAY?

WHY, I...

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU.

I WAS TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM HIM!

HE IS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE.

YOURS TOO?

UH, WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS,
PLEASE COME UP TO THE CHALKBOARD

AND DRAW A DIAGRAM
OF THE INCIDENT.

Squidward: GLADLY.

IT ALL STARTED
WHEN I LEFT MY HOUSE.

AND THEN HE APPEARED.

HE MADE AN IMMEDIATE
RIGHT TURN AND PARKED...

...HERE.

SEEING THE ONCOMING HAZARD,
I LOOKED BOTH WAYS AND PROCEEDED
SAFELY TOWARD MY VEHICLE.

IT WAS THEN THAT I REALIZED
I WAS BEING FOLLOWED
AT AN UNSAFE DISTANCE.

SO IN ORDER TO CREATE
MORE OPTIMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS

I WAS FORCED TO THEN PARTAKE
IN EVASIVE ACTION.[SCREECHING]

[ALL GROANING]

AND BY INCREASING SPEED SLIGHTLY

I CREATED A SAFETY CUSHION
WHILE INADVERTENTLY ATTRACTING

THE ATTENTION OF SAID
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL.

MAY I SIT DOWN NOW,
SWEET CHEEKS?

WHY, CERTAINLY.

AND PERHAPS NOW

SPONGEBOB WOULD LIKE
TO COME UP AND ILLUSTRATE
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.

HIS SIDE?

WELL, FIRST, I STARTED
OVER HERE, AND THEN,
I WENT WAY OVER HERE.

DOODOODOODOODOO, LIKE THAT.

AND THEN,
I WENT AROUND LIKE THIS,
AND OVER HERE LIKE THAT

AND ACROSS THIS WAY,
AND THEN DOWN HERE

AND OVER HERE LIKE THIS,
AND THEN...

AND THEN, I CAME AROUND
AND STOPPED RIGHT HERE.

Class: SPONGEBOB AND SQUIDWARD,
BEST BOATING BUDDIES FOREVER?

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

DO YOU LIKE IT, SQUIDWARD?

SHUT IT.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]

AH, LUNCH TIME,
EH, BOATING BUDDY?

I'LL HAVE TO EAT OVER HERE,
JUST LIKE BACK IN GRADE SCHOOL.

[SPONGEBOB GRUNTING]

SQUIDWARD, YOU GOT ANY

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

Mrs. Puff: OK, CLASS.

IT'S TIME FOR OUR BEHIND
THE WHEEL LESSON.

SQUIDWARD, YOU'LL BE RIDING
WITH SPONGEBOB.

YEAH, I NEVER SAW THAT COMING.

NOW, WE'RE GONNA TAKE
THIS NICE AND SLOW.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT DO WE DO
WHEN PULLING AWAY FROM THE CURB?

STEP ON THE GAS?

GOOD.

NICE AND EASY.

NOW LET'S SLOW...

[SCREAMING]

SPONGEBOB, LOOK OUT!

SPONGEBOB, GIVE ME THE WHEEL.

I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

[BELL RINGING]

[SCREAMING]

[SCREAMING]

JOHNSON, I'VE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT A WAY

TO SHRINK AN ORDINARY MAILMAN
DOWN TO THE SIZE
OF A GRAIN OF SAND.

BUT HOW?

BY USING THIS SHRINK RAY.

MOTHER OF MERCY!

WHERE'D THEY GO?

Scientist: THERE.

THEY'RE HEADED RIGHT FOR
THAT DISCARDED POTATO CHIP.

[GROWLING]

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

POTATO CHIPS
ARE HIS FAVORITE SNACK.

JOHNSON!

NO!

NO, NO, NO.

I NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND
THESE CITY FOLK.

SpongeBob: HEY,
WHERE'D SQUIDWARD GO?

[WHISTLING]

[GROWLING]

I WAS JUST LEAVING.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

Mrs. Puff: OK, CLASS, IT'S TIME
TO TAKE OUR FINAL EXAM.

PLEASE HAVE YOUR PENCILS READY.

PSST.

HEY, BOATING BUDDY.

IF YOU NEED ANY HELP, I'VE TAKEN
THIS TEST HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

I AM NOT YOUR BUDDY.

I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP,
AND I DON'T NEED YOU, EVER!

NOW, JUST KINDLY LET ME
TAKE THIS STUPID TEST

SO I CAN GET OUT OF HERE
AND NEVER HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

OK, SQUIDWARD, IF THAT'S
THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

THANK YOU.

[SQUIDWARD GRUNTING]

THREE MORE MINUTES, CLASS.

[GRUNTING]

SPONGEBOB.

SPONGEBOB, I NEED YOUR HELP.

Mrs. Puff: TWO MORE MINUTES.

SPONGEBOB, PLEASE?

THIS IS IMPORTANT.

YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
NEED MY HELP, SQUIDWARD,
AND THAT YOU DIDN'T NEED ME.

NO, NO, I DIDN'T.

I NEVER SAID THAT.

I don't need your help,
and I don't need you.

JERK.

ALL RIGHT, I SAID IT,
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE.

BEFORE WHAT?

BEFORE... BEFORE...

Mrs. Puff: ONE MORE
MINUTE, CLASS.

BEFORE WE WERE...
[GASPING], BOATING BUDDIES.

YAY!

Mrs. Puff: OKAY, CLASS,
TIME IS UP.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

TIME CAN'T BE UP.

I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO FILL IN A SINGLE ANSWER.

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

YOU DO THE SAME THING
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES
WHO FAILS THE TEST.

YOU TAKE IT AGAIN NEXT WEEK.

NEXT WEEK?

DON'T WORRY, SQUIDWARD.

I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ONE ANSWER
RIGHT ON THIS TEST

BUT WE'LL MEET AGAIN NEXT WEEK
AT MRS. PUFF'S BOATING SCHOOL.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING][SQUIDWARD SCREAMING]

[♪...]

SpongeBob: ORDER UP!

[BELL RINGING]

HOW'S IT LOOKIN' OUT THERE, BOY?

LIKE TWO MORE
SATISFIED REGULARS, MR. K.

I AIN'T INTERESTED IN THE SAME
OLD REGULARS, SPONGEBOB.

SO I TOOK OUT AN AD
IN THE BIKINI BOTTOM EXAMINER
TO BRING IN SOME NEW CUSTOMERS.

'TWAS A BARGAIN TOO.

ONLY COST ME A NICKEL.

SO TELL ME NOW, BOY.

HOW MANY NEW CUSTOMERS
WE GOT OUT THERE SO FAR?

OOH, UH, LET ME SEE.

THERE WAS... NONE.

WHAT?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NONE?

DON'T THESE PEOPLE
READ THE PAPER?

OOH.

THIS THING HASN'T BEEN
TOUCHED IN MONTHS.

WHILE THAT PAPER IS SELLIN'
LIKE KRABBY PATTIES.

EH, PARDON ME, SIR.

COULD I INTEREST YOU IN A COPY
OF THE EXAMINER THIS FINE DAY?

[LAUGHING]

NOBODY READS THE EXAMINER, BUD.

IT'S ALL FULL OF
BORING CHARTS AND FACTS.

THE BOTTOM FEEDER
IS WHERE IT'S AT.

IT'S GOT, LIKE,
INTERESTING STORIES AND STUFF.

FISH BOY STRIKES AGAIN?

WAIT A MINUTE.

AREN'T THESE STORIES
A LITTLE LESS THAN TRUTHFUL?

I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THEY'RE SELLING.

YES, THEY CERTAINLY ARE.

PLEASE, ALLOW ME.

THANK YOU.

NO, THANK YOU.

NOW, LET'S SEE HOW MUCH
THEY CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING.

[SCREAMING]

25 CENTS PER WORD?

THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS
SURE IS EASY MONEY.

THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

WHAT A "FANTABULASTICAL" DAY,
EH, SQUIDDY?

YEP, ANOTHER WONDERFUL,
HUMDRUM DAY SLINGING BURGERS.

OFF OF YOUR DUFF, BOY.

YOU THINK I SPENT ALL LAST NIGHT
ASSEMBLING THIS PRINTING PRESS

SO YOU COULD
LAZE AROUND ALL DAY?

FROM NOW ON,
YOU'LL BE TWICE AS BUSY, AND
I EXPECT YOU TO WEAR TWO HATS

'CAUSE ALONG WITH
YOUR USUAL FRYCOOKIN' DUTIES

YOU'RE MY LEAD REPORTER
FOR THE NEW KRABBY KRONICLE.

OH, MY VERY OWN PRESS BADGE!

THAT'S RIGHT, BOY.

AND HERE'S YOUR VERY OWN CAMERA.

SEE, YOU'LL NEED IT TO DOCUMENT
ALL THEM JUICY STORIES
YOU'RE GONNA WRITE.

WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITIN' FOR, BOY?

THE PUBLIC THIRSTS FOR
A JUICY STORY, EH?

HM, BUT WHAT KIND OF STORY
IS JUICY ENOUGH TO QUENCH
THEIR DRY NEWS GULLETS?

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
TO BEGIN TO LOOK.

[ALARM BLARING][PEOPLE TALKING AT ONCE]

[GROWLING]

HM, NO NEWS TO REPORT HERE.

STOP THE PRESSES, IT'S PATRICK!

AND HE APPEARS TO BE
WAITING FOR THE BUS.

THIS IS THE KIND
OF BREAKING STORY MY READERS
ARE WAITING FOR.

PATRICK STAR?

I'M SCOUP SQUAREPANTS
FROM THE KRABBY KRONICLE.

EVERYONE'S WONDERING,
WHAT BUS ARE YOU TAKING TODAY?

OH, I'M NOT TAKING
A BUS, SPONGEBOB.

I AM WATCHING THIS POLE,
SO THE NEXT TIME IT MOVES,
I WILL SEE IT.

WHOA, THIS STORY IS JUICY.

WHAT A "MONEYTASTICAL" DAY,
EH, MR. SQUIDWARD?

YEAH, I'M JUST RAKING IT IN.

I'M EXCITED ABOUT ALL
THE NEWSPAPER SALES TOO.

WE HAVEN'T SOLD
ANY PAPERS TODAY.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WE HAVEN'T SOLD ANY NEWSPAPERS?

CERTAINLY, THIS GENTLEMAN
WOULD LIKE A COPY
OF THE KRABBY KRONICLE.

LOOKS BORING.

CAN I JUST HAVE A KRABBY PATTY?

TOO BORING?

SPONGEBOB!

WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

MEANING OF WHAT, MR. KRABS?

LOCAL RESIDENT WATCHES POLE?

NO ONE'S GONNA PAY
TO READ THIS MALARKEY.

WHEN YOU WRITE THESE STORIES,
YOU GOT TO USE
A LITTLE IMAGINATION, BOY.

IMAGINATION.

YEAH.

MAYBE INSTEAD OF
"MAN WATCHES POLE"

YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING
LIKE, OH, "MAN MARRIES POLE."

THEN YOU COULD ALTER THE PHOTO
TO FIT THE HEADLINE, AND SEE?

NOW, THAT'S A JUICY STORY.

MR. KRABS, ISN'T THAT LYING?

DON'T THINK OF IT AS LYING, BOY.

THINK OF IT AS A PRACTICAL JOKE.

YOU KNOW, SOMETHING EVERYBODY
CAN HAVE A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT.

THE PUBLIC EXPECTS A LITTLE
EMBELLISHMENT HERE AND THERE

SO I WANT YOU TO GO OUT THERE
AND GET ME A LEAD STORY
THAT'LL SELL.

[LAUGHING]

MRS. PUFF IS GONNA LAUGH
HER HAT OFF WHEN SHE READS THIS.

Mr. Krabs: BOATING TEACHER
IN HIGH SPEED CHASE!

I THINK YOU'VE FINALLY
DONE IT, BOY!

YOU'VE GIVEN ME
A STORY THAT'LL SELL!

AND SELL IT HAS.

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]

YEAH, BUT THAT ISN'T
THE STORY I WROTE.

THAT'S CALLED
EDITORIAL PRIVILEGE, SON.

IT GIVES IT THAT EXTRA "OOMPH"
TO MOVE UNITS.

BESIDES, HOW COULD SUCH
A LITTLE NEWS STORY POSSIBLY
EFFECT MRS. PUFF IN ANY WAY?

I CAN'T BELIEVE SUCH
A LITTLE NEWS STORY
COULD HAVE RUINED MY BUSINESS.

LET'S SEE WHAT THERE IS TO SEE.

WAIT A MINUTE.

LARRY THE LOBSTER.

HM.

I WONDER WHAT KIND OF DIRT
HE HAS UNDER THOSE MUSCLES.

AHHA.

THIS LOOKS SHADY.

VERY SHADY.

LARRY.

HEY, TOUGH GUY.

CAN I PUNCH YOU IN THE GUT?

SURE.

EVERYBODY DOES.

IT WON'T HURT ME A BIT.

[LAUGHING]

TOLD YOU IT WOULDN'T HURT.

THANKS, BIG GUY.

SEE YOU AROUND.

VERY INTERESTING.

Male voice: OUT, OUT, OUT!

HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

THIS!

Larry: LARRY THE LOSER
GETS BEATEN UP BY PIPSQUEAK?

BUT... BUT... BUT...

NO BUTS.

I CAN'T HAVE A WIMP LIKE YOU
DESTROYING MY GYM'S REPUTATION.

YOU'RE BANNED FOREVER.

HELLO, LARRY.

NOT NOW, SPONGEBOB.

LET ME TAKE IN THE FACT
THAT MY LIFE IS RUINED.

RUINED?

WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

THESE LIES SOMEONE
WROTE ABOUT ME.

[GASPING]

Mr. Krabs: THANKS FOR
YOUR BUSINESS.

AND HERE'S YOUR PAPER.

MR. KRABS, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

MAKE IT QUICK, BOY.

THESE PAPERS ARE SELLING FASTER
THAN WE CAN PRINT 'EM.

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, SIR.

I DON'T THINK THESE STORIES
ARE DOING ANYONE ANY GOOD.

WELL, THEY'RE CERTAINLY
DOING ME SOME GOOD.

CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

LOOK AT ALL THIS LOOT!

YEAH, BUT ISN'T THERE A WAY
WE COULD WRITE JUICY STORIES
WITHOUT HURTING PEOPLE?

[SIGHING]

YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, BOY?

WE'RE NOT HURTING ANYONE.

WE'RE JUST MAKING THEIR LIVES
INTERESTING FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

NOW, GET OUT THERE
AND FETCH ANOTHER STORY.

OH, KAREN.

I THINK THIS IS IT.

THE CHUM STICK THAT'S FINALLY
GONNA DRIVE KRABS
OUT OF BUSINESS.

[LAUGHING]

Male voice: I THINK NOT.

I'M HEALTH INSPECTOR YELLOWTAIL.

I'M OFFICIALLY CLOSING
DOWN YOUR RESTAURANT.

WHY?

I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

[CHUCKLING]

THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS SAYS.

Plankton: PLANKTON'S CHUM
MADE OF YOUR CHUMS?

THE CHUM BUCKET
SERVES YOUR FRIENDS
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE?

WHAT?

WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THIS?

WHO?

[LAUGHING]

YOU'RE REACHING NEW LEVELS
OF IMAGINATION, BOYO.

YEAH, I KNOW.

WHAT'S WRONG, BOY?

YOU SICK OR SOMETHING?

YES, MR. KRABS.

YOU COULD SAY THAT.

DON'T BE SILLY, BOY.

WE'RE A SUCCESS!

MR. KRABS, WE'RE HURTING PEOPLE.

OH, BALONEY.

AND YOU BETTER START FEELIN'
RIGHT, 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T

YOU CAN JUST KISS
YOUR SPATULA GOODBYE.

MR. KRABS, YOU WOULDN'T!

OH, DARN TOOTIN', I WOULD.

NOW GET OUT THERE
AND BRING ME A JUICY ONE.

AYEAYE, CAPTAIN.

SORRY, "FELLERS".

THIS IS A PRIVATE TREE DOME.

I HAD NO IDEA IT TALKED.

DON'T WORRY.

WE'RE FROM THE NEPTUNIAN
SCIENCE COMMITTEE

AND WE'VE COME TO CONFISCATE
ALL YOUR SCIENCE AWARDS.

HAVEN'T YOU READ
TODAY'S HEADLINES?

IT CAN'T EVEN READ.

WHY ARE YOU...

OH, GIVE ME THAT!

SANDY CHEEKS OR SANDY CHUMP?

BUSHYTAILED BRAINIAC REALLY
A SLOWWITTED SQUIRREL?

BY SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS?

THAT YELLOW SIDEWINDER THINKS
HE CAN DO THAT TO ME?

OH, BOY.

WE'D BETTER SCRAM.

THE DUMB ONES ARE ALWAYS
THE MOST VIOLENT.

[GROWLING]

[MR. KRABS LAUGHING]

YOU'VE REALLY OUTDONE
YOURSELF THIS TIME.

[LAUGHING]

MR. KRABS, I CAN'T WRITE
THESE STORIES ANYMORE.

COME ON,
THAT'S A BUNCH OF HOOEY.

I'VE SEEN PEOPLE'S LIVES
RUINED WITH MY OWN EYES.

PEOPLE WANT WILD, JUICY STORIES.

THAT'S WHAT SELLS.

NOW, I WANT YOUR LITTLE,
YELLOW NOGGIN TO COME UP
WITH THE WILDEST STORY EVER.

ONE THAT'LL TOP ALL THE OTHERS.

WELL, GEE, MR. KRABS,
I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT
EVERYONE IN TOWN.

ANY IDEAS, SIR?

SURPRISE ME.

GIVE ME A SHOCKER.

GOOD NIGHT, BOY.

I'LL CHECK ON YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

AND REMEMBER,
THE WILDEST STORY EVER.

AH, THE WILDEST STORY EVER, HUH?

HOW'S IT GOIN', LAD?

AH, IT'S A SURPRISE.

Mr. Krabs: EXCELLENT.

WE'RE GONNA SELL OUT IN NO TIME.

WE'LL HAVE TO DO
ANOTHER PRINTING.

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]HUH?

TASKMASTER!

WHAT'S GOING ON?

YOU SHOULD KNOW!

KRABS OVERWORKS EMPLOYEES?

REAPS REWARD?

KRABBY KRONICLE MASTERMIND
BEHIND BOGUS STORIES

PAYS HIS TIRED,
UNDERAGE REPORTER PENNIES
WHILE HE RAKES IN THE DOUGH?

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO SUCH AN INNOCENT CHILD?

IT'S SICK AND INHUMANE.

NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT HE'S WRITTEN LIES ABOUT US.

I LOST MY RESTAURANT
BECAUSE OF YOU.

AND I THOUGHT IWAS EVIL.

ALL THE KIDS IN TOWN WANT
TO BEAT ME UP FOR LUNCH MONEY.

[SOBBING]

AND I'VE HAD TO GO BACK
TO WATCHING DAYTIME TELEVISION.

THAT'S IT!

WE'RE TAKING OUR MONEY BACK!

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

[MR. KRABS SCREAMING]

[SOBBING]

MR. KRABS, ARE YOU OK?

HOW CAN I BE OK
WHEN ME MONEY'S GONE?

[SOBBING]

ALL GONE.

[SOBBING]

IT JUST GOES TO SHOW,
TRYING TO MAKE AN EASY BUCK
DOESN'T PAY.

OR DOES IT?

GET ME SOME SCISSORS, BOYO.

IT'S TIME TO USE MYIMAGINATION.

Patrick: HEY, GUYS?

CAN YOU FIX ME AND THE WIFE UP
A COUPLE OF KRABBY PATTIES?

OH, HI, PUMPKIN.

I WAS JUST SETTING OUT
REFRESHMENTS FOR YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Pearl: CRACKERS AND TAP WATER?

YOU ARE THE CHEAPEST CRAB ALIVE.

NOW, DON'T SAY THAT.

HERE, WOULD YOUR FRIENDS
LIKE SOME PIZZA?

WELL, YEAH.

YEAH, WE WOULD.

OK, YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR ALLOWANCE EARLY.

Pearl: KETCHUP?

Mr. Krabs: SEE?

YOU PUT IT ON THE CRACKERS

[AFFECTED ITALIAN ACCENT]:

NO LOUD MUSIC AFTER 7:30.

NO TOUCHING
THE ROOT BEER CELLAR.

AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
OF ALL, NO BOYS ALLOWED.

ISN'T IT GLORIOUS?

[DOOR SLAMMING]

SWEETIE?

YOU ACCIDENTALLY
LOCKED THE DOOR.

YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK
IN THIS HOUSE UNTIL AFTER
MY SLUMBER PARTY IS OVER.

[GASPING]

THIS IS MUTINY!

Pearl: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

TAKE AWAY MY ALLOWANCE?

HERE YOU GO.

OPEN THIS DOOR, OR I'LL...

[GENERAL CONVERSATION]

YOU WANT TO STAY HERE,
AT MY HOUSE, WITH ME?

WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOY?

YAYHEY!

SLUMBER PARTY!

MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
SLEEP UNDER THE HIGHWAY.

WE CAN STAY UP REALLY,
REALLY LATE, AND TELL
GHOST STORIES, AND TRADE SOCKS.

IS THAT WHAT GIRLS
DO AT SLUMBER PARTIES?

NO.

THEY INVITE BOYS OVER
AND DESTROY THE HOUSE.

THEY WHAT?

YOU KNOW HOW GIRLS ARE.

UH, SPONGEBOB?

DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT GIRLS?

[LAUGHING]

DO I KNOW ANY...

NO, BUT GARY DOES.

[MEOWING]

Man: We now return
to tonight's scary movie,
"Slumber Party Zombie Attack."

[MAN GROWLING]

Girl: Pillow fight.

[LAUGHTER]

Girl: That tickles!

Missed me.

[GASPING]

LOOK WHAT THEY'RE DOING
TO THAT MAN'S HOUSE.

MR. KRABS, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE.

QUIET, BOY.

Girl: Boys are here.

Hi, girls.

I brought my
destructive friends.

Boy: Nice to meet you.

Boy: Hah, destroying other
people's possessions is fun!

[SCREAMING]

TURN IT OFF!

TURN IT OFF!

I CAN'T TAKE IT!

[WHIMPERING]
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
THE SCARY PART YET.

Mr. Krabs: I SAID, TURN IT OFF!

GOSH, MR. KRABS, I NEVER KNEW
YOU WERE SCARED OF ZOMBIES.

NOT ZOMBIES, YOU BARNACLE BRAIN.

TEENAGERS.

ZOMBIE TEENAGERS?

NO!

PEARL AND HER NOGOOD FRIENDS.

THEY'RE PROBABLY DESTROYING
ME HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

LIKE THIS.

"I DON'T CARE.

IT'S NOT MINE.

OH, LOOK.

ONE OF THE HOMEOWNER'S
MOST PRIZED POSSESSIONS.

LADIDA."

MR. KRABS?

"OOH, THIS'LL BE FUN TO DESTROY.

WHEE!"

NOW DO YOU GET IT, BOY?

OH, I DO, MR. KRABS.

IT MUST BE HORRIBLE
TO INVITE PEOPLE INTO YOUR HOME

AND HAVE THEM TREAT
YOUR PROPERTY WITH
SO LITTLE RESPECT.

THAT'S WHAT TEENAGERS DO.

DO YOU WANT THIS
TO HAPPEN TO MY HOUSE?

GOSH, NO, MR. KRABS.

THEN GET INTO PEARL'S PARTY
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

LEAVE IT TO ME, MR. K.

I'VE GOT THE PERFECT DISGUISE.

HUH?

YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND, BOY.

[KNOCKING]

SpongeBob: PIZZA DELIVERY.

WE DIDN'T ORDER ANY PIZZA.

YOU DIDN'T?

SPONGEBOB, TELL 'EM
IT'S FROM ME.

SpongeBob: YOUR DAD SENT IT.

IT'S ALREADY PAID FOR.

I'D SOONER BELIEVE SPACE ALIENS

WHALE TO SPONGE?

HOLD THE BOILING OIL.

WHAT DO YOU WANT, SPONGEBOB?

OH, PLEASE LET ME
STAY AT YOUR PARTY.

OH, PLEASE, OH, PLEASE,
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

NO.

GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY I CAN'T STAY.

I CAN GIVE YOU
100 MILLION BILLION REASONS.

YEESH, I ONLY ASKED FOR ONE.

REASON NUMBER ONE:
YOU'RE JUST LIKE MY DAD.

REALLY?

Pearl: A NOGOOD, DRIEDUP,
OLD FUDDYDUDDY.

SO IF I PROVE I'M FUN,
CAN I STAY?

SURE, SPONGEBOB.

IF YOU CAN PROVE YOU'RE THE MOST
FUN PERSON ON THE PLANET
IN THE NEXT 10 SECONDS

YOU CAN STAY.

I ONLY NEED EIGHT.

WHOO!

OWNERS, OWNERS, OWNERS.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T BE THIS WAY.

THEY'RE SAYING THEY DON'T WANT
THIS TYPE OF PAMPERING.

THEY WANT TO BE
TREATED AS COMPANIONS,
NOT DRESSUP DOLLS.

THEY DON'T WANT
SCRATCHY OUTFITS.

THEY WANT TO BE SCRATCHED.

THEY ARE PROTESTING
THE INDIGNITY OF WIGS
AND JEWELENCRUSTED COLLARS

AND THEY WANT TO BE FREE
FROM SUPERFICIAL AND DEGRADING
PAGEANTS, LIKE THESE.

[ALL GROWLING]

YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME THAT

DID YOU HEAR THAT, GARY?

THEY'RE REWARDING YOU
FOR STANDING UP AND SPEAKING
OUT AGAINST INJUSTICE.

MAYBE THESE PAGEANTS AREN'T
SO SUPERFICIAL AFTER ALL.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

THE SNAIL DIDN'T WIN.

THEY ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE
DISCOVERED KETCHUP

AND ENJOYED DRESSING UP
THEIR PETS AS CHUNKS OF MASONRY

ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE.

LOOK OUT!

AND GROWN VIKINGS ARE KNOWN

WHICH THEY DISPLAY AND TRADE

AT MONTHLY SOCKTRADING
CONVENTIONS CALLED

"SOCKNGARTEN."

SOCKNGARTEN.

WOW.

SQUIDWARD, DO YOU THINK
VIKINGS REALLY

DRINK THEIR BEVERAGES
IN VIKING SIZE?

OF COURSE THEY DO.

HOW ELSE WOULD MR. KRABS

COME UP WITH SUCH

DO YOU
THINK THAT...
SPONGEBOB!

CAN'T YOU SEE
I AM TRYING TO WORK?

BUT...

A 50CENT REBATE CHECK.

GIVE ME, GIVE ME,

SORRY, NO CHECK.

BUT I'VE GOT THIS.

OH, CORRESPONDENCE
IN A BOTTLE, AY?

"AHOY, EUGENE.

I'M SO PROUD YOU FOLLOWED
YOUR OLD GRANDPA'S PEG LEG
AND BECAME A PIRATE

THAT I'LL BE SAILING BY
FOR A SHIP'S INSPECTION.

THAT VESSEL BETTER BE

HAPPY LOOTIN',
GRANDPA REDBEARD."

[GASPING]: AH!

[MUTTERING GIBBERISH]

I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR GRANDPA
WAS A PIRATE, MR. KRABS?

AYE... I COME FROM
A WHOLE FAMILY OF PIRATES.

GRAMPS USED TO SAY:

"THE KRABS CLAN
HAS BEEN PIRATES

FOR AS LONG AS
WE'VE HAD CLAWS."

AND HE WANTED ME TO
BE A PIRATE, TOO.

ONE DAY YOU'LL BE
A PLUNDERING PIRATE

JUST LIKE YOUR

[LAUGHING] AARGH.

Krabs: SO I BOUGHT ME A SHIP,

TO SEE HOW YOU PROGRESS.

JUST REMEMBER, THE ONLY RULE IN
THE PIRATE'S CODE OF HONOR IS

NEVERTELL A LIE.

[WHINING]

THE KRUSTY KRAB

IF HE WERE TO FIND

IT'D BREAK HIS SALTY,

WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE

I'VE SMELLED

BUT NOTHING SMELLS STINKIER

THAN A LIE.[GULP]

THERE'S A CODE THAT
ALL PIRATES LIVE BY.

YOU KNOWS WHAT

CORAL BITS: $1.95?

SO YOU SEE, GRANDDAD...

I'M NO PIRATE.

JUST A LOWLY RESTAURANT OWNER.

I'M SORRY I FAILED YE.

[SOBBING]
FAILED ME,
BOY?

[LAUGHING]

WHY, I COULDN'T
BE MORE PROUD.

LOOK AT YER
LUDICROUS PRICES.

NOW THAT'S REAL PIRACY.

WHAT HAPPENED

THEY'RE SURE TO LET YOU BACK IN.

WHAT IS IT?

OH, IT'S YOU TWO.

WE JUST CAME TO EXPLAIN
THAT SQUIDWARD HAD NO IDEA

THAT WE FOLLOWED HIM
TO THE LODGE.

SO IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

YEAH, NOT HIS FAULT.

THEN WHOSE FAULT WAS IT?

IS IT MY FAULT?

NO, IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT, PATRICK.

THANKS, SPONGEBOB.

AND IT WASN'T

WELL, IF IT
WASN'T YOUR FAULT

AND IT WASN'T

WHOSE FAULT WAS IT?

UHH...

MAYBE IT'S

SQUIDWARD IS NEVER ALLOWED
IN THIS LODGE AGAIN.

SPONGEBOB, ARE THEY LETTING ME
BACK IN THE LODGE?

NO, YOU CAN'T SET
FOOT IN THE LODGE.

EVER!

[SNIFFLES] OHH...

NOW THAT YOU TWO HAVE RUINED
THE LAST GOOD THING IN MY LIFE

I THINK I'LL GO HOME

AND SLAM MY HEAD

SpongeBob: SQUIDWARD, WAIT.

I'M SORRY WE GOT YOU KICKED OUT
OF YOUR LODGE.

IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

NOWHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
MAKE UP YOUR OWN DUMB CLUB

INSTEAD OF
RUINING MINE?

THAT'S IT!

DO YOU STILL WANNA
BE A FEATHER FRIEND?

GRRR...

NO.
OH.

SQUIDWARD, I HADN'T
REALIZED HOW SPECIAL
YOUR LODGE WAS TO YOU.

I'LL GET YOU BACK IN THAT CLUB.

AND I KNOW JUST
HOW TO DO IT.

EVERYTHING WE NEED
IS IN THIS DRAWER.

Squidward: A SOCK?

NOT JUST A SOCK, A DISGUISE.

PATRICK AND I WILL CLIMB
INSIDE THE SOCK

AND PRETEND TO BE
A GIANT ALBINO EEL.

WE WILL THEN GAIN
ENTRANCE TO THE LODGE

AND FRIGHTEN EVERYONE INSIDE.

ONCE THEY'RE GOOD AND TERRIFIED

YOU, SQUIDWARD, WILL STORM IN,
DEFEAT THAT GIANT EEL

AND RESCUE ALL
OF THE LODGE MEMBERS.

YOU'LL BE A HERO, SQUIDWARD.

THEY'LL HAVE TO LET YOU
BACK IN THE LODGE.

HM, IT'S GENIUS.

BUT I SEE ONE FLAW
IN YOUR PLAN.

ONEFLAW?

THAT SOCK IS
WAY TOO SMALL.

YEAH, IT IS.

TIME TO BREAK OUT

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

SpongeBob: OK, SQUIDWARD,
JUST GIVE US FIVE MINUTES
AND THEN DO YOUR STUFF.

THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

NO ONE IS DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK ARE A...

I AM QUITE CONTENT BEING
SQUIDWARD Q. TENTACLES.

OH, DEAR.

I WOULD OFFER YOU
THE HIGHPAYING

AND PRESTIGIOUS OPPORTUNITY

TO COME THERE AND TEACH
YOUR VERY OWN MUSIC CLASS.

MY VERY OWN MUSIC CLASS?

DID YOU SAY
"SQUILLIAM FANCYSON"?

GOOD EVENING, PROFESSOR.

AS I WAS SAYING...

OUR FIRST...

YES.

AREN'T YOU GONNA
WRITE YOUR NAME ON THE BOARD
LIKE MOST PROFESSORS DO?

MY, MY NAME, WHAT FOR?

WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

TEACHERS USUALLY WRITE
THEIR NAMES ON THE BOARD
THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS.

[SIGHS]

WHY DON'T YOUCOME
WRITE YOURNAME ON THE BOARD?

WE'LL SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT.

[SCOFFS] OK.

THERE, NOW HOW DOES
THAT FEEL, "BILLY"?

OK, I, I GUESS.

GOOD.

NOW WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR SEAT

AND STOP POKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS?

NOW IF WE CAN
GO FOR FIVE MINUTES

WITHOUT HAVING
ANY FURTHER INTERRUPTIONS,
I'D WOULD LIKE TO...

[LAUGHS]

HEY, LOOK, IT'S SQUID

UH, "SQUILLIAM," EVERYBODY,
HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY "SQUILLIAM."

OH, UH, OH, ACTUALLY, I THINK
HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY "SQUID"

DIDN'T YOU TWO NINCOMPOOPS KNOW

I HAD MY NAME LEGALLY CHANGED
TO "SQUILLIAM FANCYSON"?

AND YOU ARE TO REFER TO ME
ONLY AS PROFESSOR SQUILLIAM

FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

NOW BLINK TWICE
SO I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND.

OK, GOOD.

HEY, HE BLINKED THREE TIMES.

WOW, ONLY EIGHT MINUTES IN

AND WE'VE ALREADY
BEEN GIVEN A MATH QUIZ.

VERY ADVANCED MUSIC CLASS,
HUH, PATRICK?

I'LL SAY.

WOULD YOU TWO NUMBSKULLS
MIND TELLING ME

WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN
MUSIC CLASS, ANYWAY?

SURE.

PATRICK'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
WAS TO LEARN TO PLAY
AN INSTRUMENT.

YOU TOLD ME YOUR RESOLUTION
WAS TO SIGN UP FOR

AN ALLNATURAL, SLIMMING,
TONING, AND INCREASED
MUSCLE MASS PROGRAM.

IT WAS.

I TRADED WITH SPONGEBOB.

AND I HAVE BEEN REALLY HAPPY
WITH THE RESULTS, SEE?

WOW, THOSE ARE
IMPRESSIVE RESULTS.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

[CLEARS THROAT]

AS YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE

MUSIC IS A...

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

MUSIC IS A...

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

[QUICKLY]: MUSIC IS
A COMPLICATED SERIES OF...

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

IS A COMPLICATED SERIES OF NOTES
THAT, WHEN PLAYED IN THE...

[LAUGHS]

SPONGEBOB, DO YOU MIND?

THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE HERE
BESIDES YOU, YOU KNOW.

AND I DON'T THINK 
THEYAPPRECIATE YOU
DEPRIVING THEM OF MYWISDOM.

[SIGHS] I'M SORRY,
"PROFESSOR SQUILLIAM."

PATRICK HERE KEEPS
TICKLING MY FOOT.

NO WAY, HE'S MAKING THAT UP.

IT WAS HIM.

YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
HE WAS TICKLING HIMSELF?

YOU BETTER TELL HIM, SPONGEBOB.

ALL RIGHT, IT WAS ME.

YOU WERE TICKLING YOURSELF.

MMHMM.

HOW?LIKE THIS.

[LAUGHS]

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!

THERE.

NOW, AS I WAS SAYING

MUSIC IS A SERIES OF COMPLEX...

[SPONGEBOB LAUGHS]

SPONGEBOB, I TOLD YOU
TO STOP TICKLING YOURSELF.

ACTUALLY, THAT TIME...
IT REALLY WAS ME.

NOW I'M GOING TO PUT SOME NOTES
ON THE CHALKBOARD.

[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

EXCUSE ME?

IS THIS SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH
THE REST OF THE CLASS?

UHUH.

GO ON, YOU'VE ALREADY
INTERRUPTED ONCE.

YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US
WHAT WAS SO VERY IMPORTANT.

WELL...

I WAS JUST SAYING THAT
THESE LINES YOU DREW

REMIND ME OF A RAILROAD TRACK.

I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING
INSIPID, INSANE

UNINTERESTING OR IRRELEVANT.

WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE WAS
A RAILROAD CONVENTION
IN TOWN LAST WEEK

AND I BOUGHT MYSELF THIS
NIFTY CONDUCTOR'S CAP.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MORE
RIDICULOUSLOOKING OBJECT

ON TOP OF
ANYBODY'S HEAD ANYWHERE.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
SUITS MY NEEDS.

WHAT ELSE DID YOU BUY
AT THIS CONVENTION?

YOUR VERY OWN LOCOMOTIVE?
[LAUGHS]

YES.

[LAUGHS]WHAT THE?

[WHISTLE TOOTS]

NOW WHERE WERE...

WE?

THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS
A METRONOME.

HEY, MY MOM HAS ONE OF THOSE
IN HER GARDEN.

OH, NO, SPONGEBOB.

THAT WAS A GARDEN GNOME.

[CLEARS THROAT] ANYWAY.

THE METRONOME
HELPS US KEEP TIME.

SpongeBob and Patrick: TICK,
TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK...

TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK....

DO YOU MIND?

TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK...

IS THERE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY
WRONG WITH YOUR HEADS?

MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN
POINTED IN ONE DIRECTION.

I SEE THAT NOW.

THERE'S NEVER BEEN
ANY CHOICE FOR ME.

WOULD YOU TWO NINCOMPOOPS
CUT IT OUT?

OR AM I GONNA...[KNOCK AT DOOR]

HELLO.

WE'RE WITH THE LOCAL
BIKINI BOTTOM NEWS CHANNEL.

TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK...

PLEASE IGNORE THEM.

ARE THOSE STUDENTS OF YOURS?

NOPE, THEY'RE JUST MORONS.

COME ON, YOU TWO,
SNAP OUT OF IT.

THEY APPEAR TO BE
IN SOME TYPE OF TRANCE.

A CASE OF GENUINE
HYPNOSIS LIKE THIS

MAKES A MUCH HOTTER SCOOP.

HOTTER SCOOP?

WELL, IT'S THE SORT OF THING
THAT BORDERS ON THE PARANORMAL.

OUR VIEWERS JUST
EAT THAT STUFF UP.

PARANORMAL?

THE ONLY THING PARANORMAL
AROUND HERE

IS HOW FAST I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU TWO DISAPPEAR.

DON'T BLAME ME...

BLAME THE MARKET...

[GRUNTS AND PANTS][SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

WHAT, WHERE AM I?

I FELT LIKE I WAS IN
SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE TRANCE.

YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

OK.
OK.

YOU ONCE AGAIN MANAGED TO
SINGLEHANDEDLY ANNIHILATE

WHAT MIGHT BE THE ONE AND ONLY
CHANCE I MAY EVER GET

TO SOW JUST ONE TINY SEED
OF CREATIVE HOPE

INTO THE CULTURALLY BARREN
WASTELAND

THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US
IS FORCED TO CALL HOME.

ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
COMMUTING FROM UPSTATE.

NOW I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TWO
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
FOR YOURSELVES.

WELL, I GUESS IF I WAS
TO SAY ONE THING

IT WOULD HAVE TO BE...

WE'RE SORRY, SQUIDWARD.

YEAH, WE'RE SORRY,
SQUIDWARD.

[STAMMERS] NONONO,
SHHSHHSHH.

HEY, DID THOSE GUYS
JUST CALL YOU SQUIDWARD?

NONONONONO,
THEY SAID SQUILLIAM.

UGH, I KNEW THIS GUY
WAS A PHONY FROM MINUTE ONE.

I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

YEAH, ME TOO.

I'M GONNA GET MY TUITION BACK.

NO, WAIT.[STUDENTS CLAMORING]

[CLAMORING]

NO!

YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

WHAT, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

SORRY, PROFESSOR,
YOUR LITTLE SYMPHONY IS OVER.

IT'S TRUE, WE'RE ON TO
YOUR LITTLE RUSE.

WHAT A HOT SCOOP.

THE REAL SQUILLIAM,
AS WE ALL KNOW

HAS A LARGE, BUSHY UNIBROW JUST

WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE!

HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK ANYONE

RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAID,

"HELLO, I'M A DECENT MEAL.
WONDERFUL TO MEET YOU.

"PLEASE, PAY MONEY FOR ME
AND THEN PUT ME IN YOUR MOUTH

"SO YOUR OLD PAL PLANKTON
DOESN'T LOSE EVERYTHING

HE'S SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
WORKING FOR!"

>> YEAH, AND IF ANYONE EVER DID
ORDER ONE OF YOUR MEALS,

IT PROBABLY WOULD LOOK THEM
IN THE EYE.

>> YOU KNOW, KAREN, SOMETIMES
I WONDER IF YOU'RE HERE

TO HELP ME RUN THE CHUM BUCKET

OR JUST TO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I'M TWO INCHES TALL.

ding!

>> MAYBE IN HEELS.

IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,

YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN
REMEMBER TO BLINK.

>> OH, COME ON.

WHEN WE FIRST MET,
YOU WERE LITTLE MORE

THAN A JUMBLED MASS
OF DIODES AND WIRES.

I MADE YOU WHAT YOU ARE TODAY,

LITERALLY.

SO DON'T THINK YOU COULDN'T BE
REPLACED IN A HEARTBEAT.

OW!

>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

>> MY EYE IS BURNING,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!

>> BLINK.

THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.

NOW WHERE WAS I?

>> YOU WERE THREATENING
TO REPLACE ME.

>> OH, YEAH.
I DON'T NEED YOU!

I COULD MAKE A WHOLE ARMY
OF COMPUTERS

THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP ME
STEAL THE FORMULA.

>> OH, PUHLEEZ.

>> I'LL SHOW YOU, WOMAN.

OH, KAREN?

[romantic music]

>> NOW WHAT.

>> COULD YOU COME HERE
FOR A MOMENT?

>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

>> FEAST YOUR...
UH...

SCREEN ON THIS.

[triumphant music]

>> THAT'S MY REPLACEMENT?

IT'S A TOASTER.

>> HA, HA, HA!

THAT, MY DEAR,
IS A T119A COMPUMATIC.

THE FINEST OF ITS KIND.

>> GOOD MORNING, SIR.

>> GOOD MORNING, T119A!

THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

SUPER SPU31

LIQUIDCOOLED MOBILE
PROCESSING UNIT.

clunk!
clunk!

>> THAT'LL HELP YOU
GET THE FORMULA.

>> AND NOW, KAREN,
THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE.

[triumphant music]

HAVE YOU EVER WITNESSED
SUCH MARVELOUS MACHINERY?

>> IT SORT OF JUST LOOKS LIKE
AN OLD HAIR DRYER

TAPED TO THE BACK
OF A MINIATURE WINDMILL.

>> I COULD SEE HOW SOMEONE
AT YOUR LEVEL

OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE
WOULD THINK THAT, KAREN.

BUT IN ACTUALITY
WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS

OH, RIGHT.

>> I DON'T RECALL
YOU EVER HAVING REASON

TO OWN A HAIR DRYER, PLANKTON.

>> OKAY, HERE WE GO.

ARE YOU GONNA MAKE ME
GET THE PICTURE DOWN AGAIN?

>> WHAT PICTURE?

>> YOU SEE?

PLENTY OF REASON TO BE USING
A HAIR DRYER.

>> WHY ARE WE EVEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

>> BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SAID

[clunking]

>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

>> DEAR NEPTUNE!

KAREN, DO SOMETHING.

QUICK!

THEY'RE TEARING
EACH OTHER APART.

JUST PRESS A BUTTON
OR SOMETHING.

[continuous beeping]

NOT THAT ONE!

[alarm rings]

AAAAAH!

[thumping]

>> WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THAT STRATEGY DIDN'T FALL FLAT.

>> YOU KNOW, KAREN,
WITH YOU AROUND

I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
HOW I'M STILL ALIVE.

>> OH, SO IT'S MY FAULT, IS IT?

>> THAT'S RIGHT!
NOW IT'S ALL CLEAR.

IT'S YOU WHO'VE BEEN
HOLDING ME BACK.

IN FACT, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR CONSTANT STIFLING,

I'D HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD RUNNING
FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR MOMMIES!

>> YOU AND YOUR CRACK TEAM
OF ROBOTS, HUH?

[mechanic noises]

>> MAYBE I COULD IRON OUT
A FEW BUGS.

BUT THEN YOU'LL SEE
JUST HOW MUCH I NEED YOU.

KAREN?

WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S WORDS ON PAPER.

IT SAYS, "DEAR PLANKTON,

"I'VE LOGGED
ONTO ANOTHER NETWORK.

"I JUST CAN'T GO INTO SLEEP MODE
AT NIGHT

"KNOWING THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE
BLAMING ME

"FOR ALL OF YOUR FAILURES.

"ANYWAY, YOU'RE A GROWN
SINGLECELLED ORGANISM

"AND ALLOWED TO MAKE
YOUR OWN SYNTAX ERRORS.

NICE KNOWING YOU.
KAREN."

HA! WHO NEEDS HER?

NOT ME.

I'M GOING TO STEAL
THAT KRABBY PATTY FORMULA

FROM MR. KRABS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

AND THEN WE'LL SEE
WHO'S MADE THE ERROR.

[laughing maniacally]

OW!

"P.S.: DON'T FORGET TO BLINK."

OH, YEAH.

OKAY, TEAM.

LISTEN UP.

WE'RE ON OUR OWN NOW,

SO WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
HOLDING US BACK.

NOW, I KNOW YOU ALL LOOK UPON ME
KINDLY SINCE I AM YOUR CREATOR,

BUT THE LAST THING

IF WE ARE GOING TO BE VICTORIOUS
IS A BUNCH OF SOFT

COULD YOU BE
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC?

THEY'RE AT THE BEACH.

BOYS, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

CLOSE UP SHOP,
WE'RE GOING TO THE BEACH TODAY.

Krabs: AHOY THERE...

WHOA.

MY NAME IS EUGENE KRABS.

AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF
I CAN INTEREST EITHER ONE OF YOU

IN A FRESH, DELICIOUS KRABBY
PATTY FRESH OFF THE GRILL.

ARE THEY FREE?

YES, TODAY THEY'RE
ONLY $3... EACH.

SOUNDS GREAT, BUT I LEFT
MY WALLET UP ON THE SAND.

I TOLD YOU.

Sandy: YEE....

WHAT?

Sandy: YEE...

...HAW, I LOVE THE BEACH.

OH, THAT NOISE WAS SANDY.

Y'ALL BE CAREFUL.

LOOKS LIKE SOME 
BIGWAVES ACOMIN'.

WHO ARE YOU?

EITHER YOU BUY A PATTY
OR GET OFF ME WAVE.

COWABUNGA.

WHAT NEXT?

[SPUTTERS]

OH, NO, OH...

ALOHA, PATRICK.

HEY THERE, YOUNG FELLOW.

HOW'D YOU LIKE TO BE
OUR FIRST CUSTOMER

IN OVER 17 WORKING DAYS?

I'D LOVE TO.

SQUIDWARD, SHOW HIM A MENU.

UH...

I CAN'T QUITE SEE IT FROM HERE.

I'LL JUST HAVE TO
CLIMB ON BOARD.

THAT'S A GOOD ONE, PATRICK,
ON "BOARD."

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

THESE WATERS ARE CALM.

TOO CALM.

BLACK SKY.

WATERSPOUTS... OF BLOOD?

JELLY DONUTS
FALLING FROM THE SKY?

WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?

THERE'S ONLY ONE LOGICAL ANSWER.

I'VE LANDED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF DUTCHMAN'S TRIANGLE.

[CHORUS SINGS EERILY]

RIGHT ABOVE DAVY JONES'S LOCKER.

[CHORUS SINGS EERILY]

IN THE DEVIL'S GALLEY.

[CHORUS SINGS EERILY]

GUYS, LOOK.

SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT SEAWEED?

JUST DRAGGING IT AROUND.

Man: HEY THERE, HODADS.

WELCOME TO OUR REMOTE ISLAND.

ISLAND?

ISLAND?

[SNORES]

THAT'S RIGHT, KEMO SABE,ISLAND.

ALTHOUGH WE SOMETIMES
REFER TO IT AS AN... ISLAND.

WE WERE JUST IN GOO LAGOON
SELLING KRABBY PATTIES

WHEN THIS BIG WAVE HIT US,
NOW WE'RE ON AN ISLAND?

THE OCEAN WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

AND WAVES.

MYSTERIOUS WAVES.

OM...

OM...

WELL, HOW DID YOU GUYS GET HERE?

OH, WE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE WE
DROPPED OUT OF JUNIOR COLLEGE.

THIS IS AWESOME EDDIE, BIG G.,
CHIP AND SILENT STAN.

AND I'M TWITCH.

WHY DO THEY CALL YOU TWITCH?

[GRUNTS] WHAT?

NEVER MIND.

SO WHAT DID YOU SAY THIS HOUSE
WAS MADE FROM AGAIN?

GUANO.

RIGHT.

WELL, IT'S BEEN FUN
HANGING OUT WITH YOU GUYS

BUT MR. KRABS DIDN'T
GIVE US THE DAY OFF

SO WE GOTTA HEAD BACK
TO GOO LAGOON.

WELL, YOU'RE MILES FROM
THAT TOURIST TRAP NOW, DUDE.

YEAH, THE ONLY WAY BACK
IS TO SURF THERE.

ONLY WAY...

BACK... SURFING?

BIKINI BOTTOM?

[SCREAMS]

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SURF.

[CRIES]

WOHO, CHILL OUT, LITTLE DUDE,
WE CAN TEACH YOU.

COOL.

Narrator: AH,
LEARNING HOW TO SURF.

TO SOME, IT COMES AS EASILY AS
EATING AN ICE CREAM CONE
ON A HOT DAY.

OTHERS... WELL...

TO THEM IT'S LIKE EATING
AN ICE CREAM CONE ON A COLD DAY.

SOMETIMES IN SURFING,
IT'S THE APPROACH THAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT.

AND SOMETIMES, IT'S THE RETREAT.

[SCREAMING]

ONCE IN A LIFETIME,
THAT PERFECT WAVE COMES ALONG.

NOT TOO BIG, NOT TOO SMALL.

AND THE SURFER
HAS TO ACT FAST...

GO...

Narrator: OR HE STANDS TO MISS
THE RIDE OF HIS LIFE.

HEY, PATRICK, WANT TO
SEE SOMETHING COOL?

YOU BET.

DOWN HERE.

SEE, IT'S A PICTURE
OF SQUIDWARD.

WOW...

Narrator: BUT ALL IN ALL,
IN LIFE...

IT'S NOT WHETHER WE WIN OR LOSE,
BUT WHETHER WE GET
TOTALLY STOKED.

WELL, DUDES, I GIVE UP.

WHAT?

THESE HODADS ARE
IMPOSSIBLE TO TEACH.

[SPUTTERS] ESPECIALLY THE ONE
ON THE END OVER THERE.

[COUGHS AND WHEEZES]

WHAT'S THAT?

[COUGHS AND WHEEZES]

OH, NO, THERE'S NO WAY,
DUDE, HE'D NEVER DO IT.

[COUGHS AND HACKS]

WHAT'S HE SAYING?

EH, HE REMINDED US
THAT THERE IS ONE DUDE
WHO COULD POSSIBLY TEACH YOU...

IF YOU CAN FIND HIM.

WHO?

HIS NAME, [GRUNTS],
IS JACK KAHUNA LAGUNA.

OR J.K.L. FOR SHORT.

AW, MAN.

WE SAY THAT LEGEND SAYS THAT
J.K.L. WAS LAST SEEN UPRIVER

AT THE KAHAMAMOKU COVE
WHERE EVERY WAVE IS PERFECT.

WILL THERE BE NACHOS THERE?

THANKS AGAIN FOR LETTING US
BORROW THESE SURFBOARDS, TWITCH.

[GRUNTS] NO PROBLEM.

AND JUST KEEP FOLLOWING
THE RIVER STRAIGHT UP

TILL YOU HIT KAKAMUKO COVE,
CAN'T MISS IT.

HOW FAR UPSTREAM
DID YOU SAY IT WAS?

WELL, WE DON'T KNOW

'CAUSE WE'VE NEVER
EVER BEEN THERE.

WE'RE DEATHLY AFRAID
OF THIS RIVER

AND WOULDN'T EVEN SET FOOT IN IT
IF YOU PAID US.

YEAH, INTERPRET THAT
ANY WAY YOU WANT.

[♪...]

OH, WHERE AM I?

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

I'M STRANDED.

SPONGEBOB, WHERE ARE YOU?

Man: I MAKE A BEELINE
FOR THE TREE LINE

GETTING BACK TO NATURE
ALWAYS DOES ME GOOD

I'LL MAKE A BEELINE

OH, DON'T WORRY, SQUIDWARD,

SO WE MAY GET BACK HOME?

UH...LOOK, SURFBOY...

HOW TO SURF

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU TWO

BUT I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE
AT SOME POINT.

AND IF HIS IDEA
OF TEACHING US IS...

OH, WONDERFUL.

QUIET, SQUIDWARD,
I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO
RECEIVE ANOTHER LESSON.

JUST KEEP BREATHING.

THAT'S IT?

I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

WOULD IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER IF
I WENT AND TALKED TO HIM?

OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, SPONGEBOB.

WELL, DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

YEP.

AND?

HE SAID, WE JUST HAVE TO
STARE INTO THIS FIRE ALL NIGHT

AND THE SECRETS
WILL BE REVEALED.

WE'RE GONNA BE
STUCK HERE FOREVER.

WELL, SANDY,
USING ONLY YOUR BARE HANDS

AND THE RESOURCES FOUND ON
THIS DESERTED ISLAND

YOU HAVE NOT ONLY SURVIVED
BUT THRIVED.

YOU BUILT A FIVESTAR HOTEL...

A STEAMPOWERED GENERATOR...

A CAR THAT RUNS ON
COCONUT MILK...

AND EVEN AN ESPRESSO BAR.

BUT I MISS BIKINI BOTTOM.

NOW RUN ALONG, PATRICK,

READY?

A SANDWI

[gags]

>> I CAUGHT IT!

WASN'T THAT COOL, SPONGEBOB?

>> I CAN ASSURE YOU,
THAT WAS NOTCOOL.

JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

YOUR BUFFOONERY HAS DESTROYED
THE LIFEGUARD TOWER.

WHY DON'T YOU FIND SOMETHING
TO DO THAT'S LESS OBNOXIOUS.

>> LIKE WHAT?

>> I DON'T KNOW.

GO PLAY IN THE SAND
OR SOMETHING.

>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

PLAYING WITH THE SAND SOUNDS
PRETTY BORING.

THERE ARE PLENTY OF FUN THINGS
TO DO IN THE SAND.

WE CAN DRAW, OR PRACTICE

AND I'LL START BY MAKING A QUEEN
TO RULE BY YOUR SIDE.

>> ALL RIGHT, PATRICK.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

YOU KEEP TO YOUR TERRITORY,
AND I'LL KEEP TO MINE.

WHO CAN BUILD A CASTLE.

LET'S SEE SPONGEBOB

JUST IN CASE KING PINKY
GETS ANY FUNNY IDEAS.

OH, SIR, YOU BUILT ONTO MY SIDE.

THAT RESTORES THE INTEGRITY

I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT FOR.

>> WHAT FOR WHAT?

I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

NO MORE DESTRUCTION
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, OKAY?

OKAY, BACK TO SQUARE ONE AGAIN.

I HEREBY PROPOSE
A NONAGGRESSION TREATY

TO END HOSTILITIES
BETWEEN OUR TWO KINGDOMS.

PATRICK, BY SIGNING
THIS HISTORIC ARMISTICE,

YOU HAVE BROUGHT PEACE
TO OUR LANDS.

MAY YOUR KINGDOM PROSPER.

WELL, THAT WENT WELL.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ABOUT THE TREATY?

>> THIS TREATY AIN'T WORTH
THE SAND IT'S PRINTED ON.

>> OH, IS THAT SO?

WELL, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
TAKE DOWN THIS CASTLE

MY ANSWER IS: BRING IT ON!

>> PATRICK, I'M TRYING
TO BE THE NICE GUY HERE, OKAY?

LET'S CALL
THIS SILLY BUSINESS OFF.

YOU STARTED IT.

>> FINE!

WHATEVER.

NO, NO, NO, NO.
AH.

OR SHOULD I SAY, MY FRIENDENEMY?

LET'S HAVE SOME REAL FUN.

HUH?

>> OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED,
PATRICK.

I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

>> ME TOO.

WAS IT WORTH IT?

>> NO, NO.
IT WASN'T.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS A FUN DREAM
TURNED INTO A HORRIBLE,

BRUTAL NIGHTMARE.

AS THE WINDS OF TIME CHANGE
THE SILVERY SANDS OF THESE DUNES

TO A NEW LANDSCAPE,
SO LET US HOPE

THAT OUR OWN WINDS OF CHANGE
WILL CHANGE OUR SPIRITUAL DUNES

TO A LANDSCAPE OF PEACE.

OH, BUDDY, LET'S NEVER FORGET
THIS LESSON.

>> AND LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET

WHO'S GONNA CLEAN THIS PLACE UP.

both: OH, WOW.

>> BETTER GET STARTED.

YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH BEAUTY.

NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE IT.

I DECREE THIS KINGDOM
TO BE CALLED THE CHUM CAVERNS,

AND MAY THE PEOPLE

SHUDDER IN AWE OF ITS MAJESTY.

>> HURRY UP, MOM.

I WANT TO SEE THE CHUM CAVERNS

YEAH, BABY.

AND WHAT'S THAT RIDICULOUS THING
ON YOUR HEAD?

AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY
AT THE CHUM CAVERNS GIFT SHOP.

>> HOW DARE YOU SPEND
ALL THE MONEY I DON'T PAY YOU

AT ME ARCHRIVAL'S BUSINESS?

BOY, PLANKTON'S REALLY
CLEANING UP DOWN THERE,

WHICH MEANS THE ONLY WAY
TO PICK THIS BUSINESS UP

IS TO RUN IT INTO THE GROUND.

>> ANOTHER ORDER OF CHUM BALLS.

[faint grinding]

HUH?

[rock cracking]

KRABS?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

>> I'M HERE TO STEAL BACK

WITH THE SAVORY FLAVOR
OF A KRABBY PATTY.

NOW, GO GET IT.

[gasps of delight]

>> KRABS!

YOU CAN'T JUST SLITHER DOWN HERE

IT'S UNETHICAL.

THIS IS ALL PERFECTLY LEGIT.

I CALL FULL DRILLING RIGHTS

HE ALWAYS WAS GOOD
WITH LEGAL JARGON.

ALL RIGHT, KRABS,

IF YOU THINK IT'S FAIR
TO UNDERCUT MY BUSINESS,

HOW DOES IT FEEL, KRABS,

BEING IN THE HOLE,
SO TO SPEAK?

NOT WELL, I'D IMAGINE.

NOW, HOLD STILL
SO I CAN BURY YOU.

FINE, KRABS,

OH!

>> PLANKTON, I DON'T THINK
YOU GRASP THE SEVERITY

OF OUR SITIATION.

WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE,

AS IN, THERE IS NO WAY OUT!

>> HA!

THERE MAY BE
NO WAY OUT FOR YOU, KRABS,

BUT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

MY DIMINUTIVE STATURE
ALLOWS ME

TO SLIP THROUGH RUBBLE
WITH EASE.

I CAN'T MAKE IT.

WE'RE DOOMED!

[both sobbing]

>> AH, LOOK AT US.
OLD, GRAY.

>> NEARING THE END.

>> SAY, PLANKTON,

IF WE EVER MAKE IT OUT OF HERE
WITH OUR LIVES,

LET'S AGREE TO WORK TOGETHER.

>> YOU'RE RIGHT, KRABS.

LET'S BURY THE HATCHET
NOW AND FOREVER.

>> WE HAVE A DEAL.

NO MORE BICKERING.

>> NO MORE SKULLDUGGERY
OF ANY KIND.

>> YEAH.

HANG ON A MINUTE.

DON'T YOU HEAR THAT?

[faint grinding]

>> SURPRISE!

>> YOU FOUND US, BOY!

OHHO!
I SHOULD PAY YOU FOR THIS.

>> OR JUST PAY ME FOR THE JOB
I ALREADY DO.

>> HEY, PLANKTON,
WE'RE FREE!

WHERE'D HE GO?

>> I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU, KRABS.

[laughs]

>> YOU BETTER NOT BE TRYING
TO STEAL ME FORMULA.

>> I AM, AND I WILL.

>> BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR DEAL?

>> WHAT?
WE'RE STILL WORKING TOGETHER.

COME ON, YOU'RE HELPING ME
STEAL YOUR FORMULA.

>> THAT'S IT.

JUST WAIT TILL I GET ME CLAWS

>> AH!

>> SATISFIED WITH YOURSELF,
PLANKTON?

NOW YOU TRAPPED US ALL
UNDERGROUND.

>> BUT AT LEAST WE'RE TRAPPED
IN A GOOD RESTAURANT.

WE GONNA DO?

WELL, THE LAST TIME
I REMEMBERED COUGHING LIKE THAT

I WAS SITTING AT HOME EATING
A BOX OF KELP JERKY.

OH, AND YOU WERE COUGHING
BECAUSE YOU GOT SOME
STUCK IN YOUR THROAT?

I GOT THE TV REMOTE
STUCK IN MY THROAT.

PATRICK,
THIS CLAM IS CHOKING.

LUCKILY, I COME PREPARED.

THERE, THERE, CLAMMY.

SPONGEBOB,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

THEY LIKE THIS.
NO.

YOU ALWAYS GIVE
A CHOKING VICTIM

THE "SLIMELICH"
MANEUVER FIRST.

AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK

YOU WALK AWAY AND PRETEND
LIKE YOU NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE.

LIKE THIS.

READY CLAM?

[GRUNTING]

Patrick: OHH!

WELL, SPONGEBOB, I THINK
I MIGHT GO CATCH A MOVIE.

HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE CLAM?

WHAT CLAM? I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT CLAM BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

BUT...

[GASPS] PATRICK.

THE CLAM HAD A BABY.

THAT'S NOT A BABY,
SPONGEBOB.

WELL THEN,
WHAT COULD IT BE?

I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

WHAT'S WHITE AND ROUND
AND COMES OUT OF CLAMS?

THEIR... EYES?

NO, SILLY, A VOLLEYBALL.

A BABY VOLLEYBALL.

[CHEERING AND WHOOPING]

I GOT IT!

[GRUNTS]: OH.

GOOD IDEA,
COMING HERE, PATRICK.

THAT'S MY SPECIALTY.

HAVING GOOD IDEAS?NO.

BEING CALLED PATRICK.

MAYBE WE SHOULD DO
SOME STRETCHES FIRST.

GOOD IDEA.

WELL, THAT'S
MY SPECIALTY.

HAVING GOOD IDEAS?

NOPE, DOING SOME
STRETCHES FIRST.

YEAH, NO, I DON'T KNOW.

THE THING'S 100 YEARS OLD, HOW
SHOULD I KNOW?

YEAH, ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT...

[CASH REGISTER RINGS]UHHUH, YEAH.

...WELL, I...

UH, YEAH, I'M...
I'M STILL HERE.

SpongeBob: 138, 139...

GENTLEMEN.

HELLO.

I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING

WHAT A LOVELY BALL THAT IS.

OH, REALLY?

YES.

I'D SURE LIKE TO
GET A CLOSER LOOK.

OH, WE DON'T MIND,
DO WE, PATRICK?

WELL, JUST DON'T
TAKE TOO LONG.

WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO START PLAYING WITH IT.

OH... [CHUCKLES]

IT, UH, WON'T TAKE
LONG AT ALL... OOH.

IT'S HEAVIER
THAN I IMAGINED

AND, UH, SHINIER TOO.

WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

WE FOUND IT DEEP
IN JELLYFISH FIELDS.

REALLY?

WHAT WAS IT
DOING THERE?

CHOKING A CLAM.

WELL, UM... [CLEARS THROAT]

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I WERE TO OFFER YOU

A SMALL FORTUNE IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR SHINY BALL?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SMALL FORTUNE?

[♪...][TRUCK HORN HONKS]

WHOA, HOW MANY MORE TRUCKS DO
YOU THINK THERE'LL BE, PATRICK?

HUH?

OH, I DON'T KNOW.

I AM GETTING
KIND OF HUNGRY, THOUGH.

I'LL CATCH UP WITH
YOU LATER, SPONGEBOB.

WELL, THAT LOOKS
LIKE THE LAST OF 'EM.

THE LAST
OF WHAT?
OH, HI, PATRICK.

SO DID YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

WITH THIS FAT
STACK OF CABBAGE YET?

YUP, I MEAN, NOPE.

WELL, MY DAD ALWAYS TOLD ME:

"WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY, YOU NEED
TO DO MORE THAN JUST SPEND IT.

YOU NEED TO HAVE A PLAN."

WOW, YOUR DAD
REALLY TOLD YOU THAT?

WELL, WHAT HE SAID WAS

"HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
TELL YOU NOT TO STAND THERE?"

BUT I KNEW WHAT HE MEANT.

HEY, PATRICK, I KNOW
A GOOD PLACE TO GO

WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BUY.
YOU DO?

THE MALL.

WHOO!

AWW...AWW...

PATRICK, WHERE'D YOU GO?

OH, THERE YOU ARE.

OH, WASN'T THAT
INCREDIBLE, PATRICK?

I MEAN,

WE COULD'VE BOUGHT
ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

[CHUCKLES]:
HEY, ME TOO.

I DIDN'T REALLY ASK
WHO THEY'RE FOR?

THANKS.

FOR THE ICE CREAM.

OH, THAT'S OK.

I KIND OF HAVE
MORE MONEY

LOOKS LIKE MY EXWIFE WAS WRONG.

I AMIN THE RIGHT
LINE OF WORK.

UH, TRIPLE "GOOBERRY"

THAT'S GONNA BE $2.98.

UH, HEY, BERT, YOU GOT LIKE,

YEAH, LET ME CHECK.

NO, I DON'T, BILL, SORRY.

YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT
I ALWAYS HAVE MONEY

WHEN YOUNEED TO BORROW IT?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, I...

ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
LOW ON FUNDS?

LET ME HELP.

HERE YOU GO.

WHOA, UH, THAT'S OK.

[LAUGHING]: YEAH.

AH, I LOVE THAT STORY.

UH, HEY, GUYS.

HAVE YOU SEEN
SPONGEBOB AROUND?

UH, IS THAT GUY
TALKING TO US?

[PARTYGOERS CONVERSING]

SPONGEBOB?

HEY, PAL,

LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.

I GOT TOO MUCH HAIR ANYWAYS."

[ALL LAUGHING]

SPONGEBOB?

SPONGEBOB!

THAT'S MY NAME,
DON'T WEAR IT OUT.

[LAUGHING...]

SPONGEBOB, I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW.

YOUR HOUSE IS
FULL OF STRANGERS.

OH, PATRICK,
THESES AREN'T STRANGERS.

THESE ARE 497 OF
MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

RIGHT, EVERYBODY?

All: YEAH!

THAT'S RIGHT!

All: [CHEERING]: YEAH!

PATRICK, DO YOU HEAR THAT?

THAT IS THE SOUND OF LOVE.

SPONGEBOB, IF YOU
KEEP THROWING YOUR
MONEY AWAY LIKE THAT

YOU WON'T HAVE
ANY LEFT AND THEN...

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

IS THIS MAN
GIVING YOU TROUBLE?

SPONGEBOB!

LIKE I WAS
SAYING...
BUT...

WE DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE.

NOW JUST KEEP MOVING.

DUDE, HOW DID
YOU GET IN THERE?

AND I TOLD HIM, "IT'S NOT
THAT I MIND THE MACARONI.

WHAT I MIND IS..."

SORRY ABOUT
THAT, SPONGEBOB.

WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

NO MATTER,
HE'S SIMPLY JEALOUS

OF MY GLAMOROUS NEW LIFESTYLE.

[CHUCKLES]:
SAY, THAT REMINDS ME.

CAN I HAVE
SOME MONEY?

WHY CERTAINLY.

I ALWAYS REMEMBER TO...

OH, THE SAME THING
US SEA STARS ARE
USUALLY DOING, I GUESS.

LAYING UP AGAINST A ROCK.

PATRICK,
I WAS WRONG.
ABOUT WHAT?

THE MONEY...

AND ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE
BEING MY FRIENDS.

THERE IS NO
RIGHT OR WRONG

WHEN IT COMES TO
THAT STUFF, SPONGEBOB.

THERE JUST EITHER IS
OR THERE ISN'T.

PATRICK, IF HAVING A BUNCH
OF MONEY MAKES ME FORGET
THAT YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND

THEN I DON'T WANT
ANY MORE MONEY, EVER AGAIN.

WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU SAY SO, BUDDY?

I'VE BEEN WAITING

EVER VISITED YOU AT HOME?

ONLY ONCE.

TO TAKE BACK SOME

HE EVEN GOT THE RUG RIGHT.

GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF,
SQUIDDY, OLD BEAN.

THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

THIS, THIS... ALL OF
THIS IS JUST, JUST...

MIMICRY.

HE DOESN'T POSSESS YOUR STYLE

OR YOUR DECORATING ACUMEN

OR YOUR LOVE OF
THE FINER THINGS.

IN FACT, THE ONLY THING
HE HAS IS...

IS, IS...

MY VACUUM CLEANER.

AND I'LL REMEDY THAT

...POSTHASTE.

THESE PANTS ARE MORE POWERFUL
THAN I THOUGHT.

'COURSE IT WAS JUST SANDY.

AND NEPTUNE KNOWS WHAT GOES ON
INSIDE A SQUIRREL'S HEAD.

[CHATTERING]

THEY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO WILL THEIR FINGERNAILS

TO WHATEVER LENGTH THEY WANT.

MAN, YOU'RE JUST LIKE
ALL THE REST.

DON'T GO.

WHAT IF I THERE WAS A WAY
TO FREE YOU

FROM THIS MAGICAL CAGE?

THEN YOU COULD COME
TO YOUR FATHER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

AND SETTLE YOUR DIFFERENCES.

THEN I'D ASK YOU TO BRUSH
YOUR TEETH FIRST, DUDE.

PEEYEW!

SORRY, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK IN A COUPLE DAYS.

MY THROAT'S A LITTLE DRY.

[coughs]

THIS CAGE IS ONLY SO BIG, MAN.

I'M SORRY.

I'LL STOP TALKING.
I SWEAR.

NEVER MIND.

JUST UNDO THE LOCK.

BOY, THIS REALLY DOES
LOOK COMPLICATED.

OH, I SEE.

I'LL JUST SLIDE THIS SQUARE
TO THE RIGHT.

THIS ONE GOES UP.

THIS ONE OVER HERE.

ANDNO, WAIT.

NO.

NO.

NO.

[screams]

MAN, THAT REALLY IS
A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

THAT LOCK WAS FORGED
BY THE GODS!

NOT JUST ANY NUMBSKULL
CAN OPEN IT

LIKE IT'S SOME CHEAP BAG
OF POTATO CHIPS

THEY FOUND IN THE STREET.

CHEAP BAG OF POTATO CHI

WAIT A MINUTE!

WHICH WAY TO THE NEAREST
PHONE BOOTH?

THERE'S ONE BEHIND THAT ROCK
OVER THERE,

BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT

HELLO,
PATRICK?

HEY! HEY!

YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT I FOUND
TODAY IN THE STREET

YEAH, I'LL HURRY.

OH, PATRICK, YOU MADE IT.

THIS IS THAT MAGICAL LOCK
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

HMM.

YEAH, I TRIED IT
FOR HOURS AND HOURS,

BUT I JUST CAN'T GET IT TO

OPEN!
WOW, ALREADY?

PATRICK, YOU KNOW,
I'LL NEVER FIGURE OUT

HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THOSE
SO DARN FAST.

IT'S EASY.

I JUST PEEL THE STICKERS
OFF THE SQUARES

AND PUT 'EM DOWN
WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO.

AMAZING!

WELL, NOW THAT THIS
SILLY OLD CAGE IS OPEN,

WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO PAY MY OLD MAN A VISIT?

HATE TO KEEP HIM WAITING
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

WELL, YOU GUYS COMING
OR WHAT?

WOW.

ARE YOU GONNA TAKE US
FOR A RIDE?

A RIDE.

THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

[upbeat rock music]

[both snoring]

both: OH!

[tires squealing]

[tires screeching]

HEY, YOU GUYS DON'T MIND
IF I PULL OVER HERE

FOR A SECOND, DO YOU?

SURE, TRITON.

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO,
USE THE BATHROOM?

NO, TO TELL YOU
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

WHAT AN INTERESTING MAN.

READY FOR A ROOM TEMPERATURE
KRABBY PATTY YET?

NOPE.

[grumbles]

CAREFUL.

THIS IS MADE OF IMPORTED WOOD.

IMPORTED ALL THE WAY
FROM THAT JUNK PILE OUT BACK.

NEPTUNE'S INCONSOLABLE.

MAYBE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
TO DISTRACT HIM FROM HIS PAIN.

WELL, THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN USUALLY DO THAT

IS SOMETHING THAT HURTS MORE
THAN THE ORIGINAL PAIN.

GREAT IDEA.

GO PLAY 'EM ANOTHER SONG.

HE'S BACK.

OH.

HOW...NICE?

IF IT PLEASES THE KING,

I WOULD LIKE TO PERFORM A

[claps slowly]

[car horn honks]

WHAT THE

BEHOLD!

WHAT'D HE SAY?

I THINK HE WANTS US
TO LOOK OUT THE

OH, MY!

[cheers]

THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!

YEAH, DEFINITELY WORTH
THE 5 BUCKS.

SON?

SON, I DEMAND TO KNOW
THE MEANING

OF THIS IMPUDENT IMPRISONMENT.

WELL, IT TURNS OUT
YOU WERE RIGHT, OLD MAN.

BEING TRAPPED IN THAT CAGE
ALL THOSE YEARS

WITH NOWHERE TO GO
BUT UP IN HERE

MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING.

DABBLING IN THE WORLD
OF MERE MORTALS

IS TOTALLY LAME.

AND THIS IS HOW YOU INTEND
TO SHOW IT?

NO, MAN.

THIS IS HOW!

[laughs maniacally]

BY FLYING THROUGH THE ROOF?

THAT WAS TRITON,
NEPTUNE'S SON.

I THOUGHT HE WAS
IN REFORM SCHOOL OR SOMETHING.

HEY, CAN I HAVE AN AUTOGRAPH?

SURE, YOU CAN.

[all screaming]

[screams]

NOTHING CAN STOP ME!

[laughs]

WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?

HELLO?

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

DO YOU THINK MAYBE TRITON
WAS IN THAT CAGE FOR A REASON?

[gasps]
THE KRUSTY KRAB!

IT'S STILL STANDING.

BUT LOOK.

THAT MAIL HASN'T BEEN
PICKED UP TODAY.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

WE'D BETTER USE
THE SECRET ENTRANCE.

BE VERY, VERY QUIET.

GOT YOU, PAL.

[thunderous clanging]

WHAT?

PLEASE!

I'LL BE RUINED.

DON'T WORRY, MR. KRABS.

NO ONE WAS GOING
TO PAY FOR THEM ANYWAY.

[cries]

OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE.

TELL ME ABOUT IT.

I NEVER GET FREE FOOD HERE.

SON, HEAR MY WORDS.

I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT

TO KEEP ME LOCKED UP
IN THIS CAGE AND ZAP ME,

BUT SEE IT IN YOUR HEART
TO RELEASE THESE OTHERS,

FOR THEY ARE INNOCENT.

WELL, MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM.

SORRY, OLD MAN.

YOU LOST ME
AT THE "HEAR MY WORDS" PART.

HE'S UNSTOPPABLE.

ONLY AS LONG AS KING NEPTUNE
IS LOCKED UP.

ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

YEAH, TRIPLE GOOBERRY SUNDAES
TONIGHT AFTER WE FREE 'EM?

NO, BUT I LIKE YOUR IDEA
BETTER!

MAKE READY THE DISGUISE.

OKAY. NOW.

NO! PLEASE!

NO MORE!

QUICK, PATRICK.

UNLOCK IT BEFORE HE SEES US.

YOU GOT IT.

SPONGEBOB,
SCOOCH BACK A LITTLE.

EXCUSE ME.

OKAY, GOT IT.

YOU BETTER HURRY IT UP,
PATRICK.

HE'S GETTING BORED.

DON'T RUSH ME!

OKAY, GOT IT!

zap!

[laughs nervously]

I WAS JUST KIDDING, MAN.

NO.
NO, PLEASE.

I NEVER MEANT TO

SON, I HAVE TRIED ALL MY LIFE
TO BE GENTLE,

BUT THIS TIME, YOU HAVE

ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS DESTRUCTION?

DON'T SEND ME BACK
TO THE CAGE, MAN.

III

THE CAGE?

WHY, SON,
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME

THE BEST
5,000TH BIRTHDAY PRESENT

I'VE EVER RECEIVED!

YOU'VE FINALLY LEARNED
TO USE YOUR GOD POWERS.

NOW I KNOW THAT WHEN MY REIGN
COMES TO A CLOSE,

I WILL HAVE A WORTHY SUCCESSOR,

AND THAT'S REALLY ALL I COULD
EVER HOPE FOR AS A KING...

[sniffles]
AND AS YOUR FATHER!

COME HERE, YOU.

AW, DAD.
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

HUZZAH!

YAY!

WHOOHOO!
YEAH!

HURRAY!
WHOO!

CELEBRATE!

NOW LET'S GO HOME, SON.

[cheers]

TOODLEOO!

[cheers]

NEPTUNE AND FRIENDS, WAIT!

WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY?

WHAT ABOUT ME RESTAURANT?

AH, YES!

MANY THANKS,
WHOEVER YOU ARE!

IT WAS THE BEST BIRTHDAY
I COULD EVER HAVE HOPED FOR,

AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
OF YOUR LITTLE EMPLOYEE THERE.

NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS ACTIONS.

DID YOU HEAR THAT?

NEPTUNE SAID THIS
WAS ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

WELL, SPONGEBOB, THAT'S

DID YOU HEAR THAT?

NEPTUNE SAID THIS WAS ALL
BECAUSE OF THAT GUY.

HE DID, DID HE?

UH, SPONGEBOB?

YES, PATRICK?

DO YOU THINK RIGHT NOW
MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME

TO GO GET THOSE
TRIPLE GOOBERRY SUNDAES

YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

I THINK RIGHT NOW
MIGHT BE AN EXCELLENT TIME.
